thought even possible i want to begin the process of a literary critical study of the pornography posted on to identify the major and present in the posted there opening up then the possibility of an objective moral evaluation of the material present there first off let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about you sick you are immoral you are all going to hell which to be the usual religious post found on the hierarchy hopefully you wont get flamed either you will however be with i personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground first i do not believe that there is any way to find an objective morality morality and value are inherently subjective they represent the of a person or a group of people they can be widely perhaps even overwhelmingly but they are never and can never be objective a bedrock assumption that all that is true comes truly from god regarding while perhaps even from an objective standpoint the majority of its material is indeed repugnant you come to this conclusion quite quickly when you start thinking about its material like this some of it some fairly profound needs in people as well as some and deserve to be pointed out second i do not accept the that you make here if as you say you are trying to be objective then why accept a morality to begin with by the your own purpose by doing so in the long run the advantage of making such a analysis is that it will save between and non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of the stuff on these pornographic third call me a pessimist but you wont stop the there will always be people who pop to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are just out of curiosity do show up unprovoked in the religion to tell you all that you are overbearing basically there should not be a dissonance between a morality and a one either there is value in a particular work or there is not whether one is a or not let me provide an example four people get together over dinner to discuss morality you me a rather conservative and a i start off by saying that i think its immoral to force people to have sex with you you agree but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender just a note i really dont know your on homosexuality i am just this as a common view of morality for the of this example the that it is immoral for to have their uncovered the who become all three of us and eats us but no guilt because he done nothing wrong morally in his own mind in support for the first assumption the say this evidence not going to accept your evidence for this you ask us to accept the word of god that everything good comes from god this is only a valid argument for a person who your still i must say that the major and in erotica could be interesting for other than yours so good luck with this next part now then what are some of the major in the pornographic literature on like these are some that been able to identify please on them motif the in so many of the there is expressed a feeling of alienation and worthlessness on the part of the writer or otherwise protagonist of the story with regard to the object the other person of desire often a story a protagonist who on the surface is quite average but underneath usually an enormous dick who to in some way to gain access in a definitely sexual way to the other person who is far more than is and who indeed to walk between the i detect just a wee bit of here motif a celebration of indeed preoccupation with beauty not very objective the vast majority of pornographic literature with beauty be it innocence somehow about to be lost grace or simply physical beauty and generally most people or non will say that beauty is good one could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better or more good than people i would hope that people that this is not necessarily true motif dick is instrument of redemption might i suggest the word penis it more in line with the tone of your post blessed are those who are for they shall get laid from what would thus be a bravo i respect you and your sense of humor sir motif sex as an expression of sincere giving there is often enough a clear desire on the part of the protagonist to give definitely sexual pleasure to the object person of yes and this theme is usually what the better are about however they are not always selfish i could point to in the work of elf for example motif a sex which is completely removed from the realm of life so removed is sex from its procreative dimension on that one to wonder why sex even ejaculation as in the context in pornography it then no real purpose it the same purpose as it does in pornographic it the virility of the male involved as well as assuring the reader that he the character the whole picture is probably very well by the catholic teaching on this of the husband and wife in an act of total mutual in the sexual union with god in opening themselves up for the transmission of new life humane your whole picture unfortunately only to people who accept your church in addition if sex is for procreation then why did god make it pleasurable so that people would want to do it rather than building it in as instinct why did god make it fallible not every sexual encounter in pregnancy even among does this mean that they have in any case and the catholic teaching will probably not see eye to eye on this for a long time motif sex used as an instrument violence power and humiliation why pornography to tend in that direction i really do not know probably could be written on the between sex and but this probably good reason why traditionally been so negative with regard to sexuality it to tend to a great moral morass pornography would not tend in those

religious many would get the impression that we were trying to outlaw religion if we to try to remove all with a religious reference thats not what the people think perhaps you would be right if you said the would think this way after all they think they are being oppressed when they are not to oppress however you have not shown where you get this idea that many people would probably think its atheism religion winner take all as far as i can tell it is your groundless prediction that this will happen but you havent taken into the account of remember if you before if the be they would probably answer no but after the machine rolled through at least some were able to tolerate it you see it only a small group of to whip up a general frenzy the have been in gear over a number of abortion and look at some of the that have well so far they have one amendment which is currently under intense scrutiny and they have to outlaw abortion which is their prime goal on that issue yep they seem effective sure well they havent to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the but they have to create quite a few for people that to have an abortion they could create similar for us and it could be worse they can try to stop by blocking but imagine what have to do to stop atheism besides the margin of error is very large when you only talk to two people better than your one that is your opinion also i have branched out and the informal survey is up over half a dozen now and what have they said were you unbiased you would claim that my are the minute i posted them because the agreed with me everyone i have about the possible removal of the motto the portion expressed regret about its loss because they like it however when it is pointed out to them that a new motto will not be in the works none have expressed the desire to rape murder pillage which you have basically so you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a whole room of them a whole nation as for the atheist portion i know some around here they have all expressed disgust with the motto some noted being by who used the motto to try to seem and all would see it gone yes id be glad if it were gone to never it however i think that it is a minor problem that can be easily with what could happen an what may be likely which designed the motto does the motto say anything about why do you think that it only to wrote it think that their religion is right and all are wrong therefore why would they include other in the realm of being correct i doubt that any other were meant to be included well i am not clear on the religious of key the motto can be to him but it is at least clear that he in a god and surely there are a few that think as you say but i dont think that most do do you think that all actively despise other most that i have met havent and dont do so no that i have it anything but them and only them why not ask some people of other sorry i would but is just so awfully popular around here suppose you could ask a few people well i have a and a few and all of them think that it is applicable to them of course i cant say that these people just some that i know pretty well are accurate of their it is always a good idea to assume that there were dissenting on any given issue you are assuming that all the were the same and nothing to this conclusion without evidence to the contrary i doubt that there were dissenting you claim there were provide some evidence for your assertion well id really like to and tried but i really dont know where to get access to congressional from the can anyone help out here to interesting only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their no again the motto on the money doesnt cost you anything extra however if you the motto wed all have to pay to have all the and like people before to get them to have the motto on them you now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again also i doubt that they use same for more than a printing this would make it easy to remove the motto simply make next without it your claim evidently is that they will have to pay extra somewhere provide some evidence for this assertion so are you saying that they redesign the each year anyway your whole argument conveniently i see was that the motto somehow us all a lot of money this is just not correct the i read didnt mention anything about i think the issue was concerning the distinction between religion and not how could it be between religious and not religious the motto to god it is a religious motto the question is whether or not it is only you say it is more i doubt this provide some evidence for this assertion that is to say the religion of this country and the nonreligion of the that was what most of those were about and some included all in general as well i dont think that any of the although i seem to have lost them anything at all about they religion over nonreligion a specific religion was not you have this point i said that the motto didnt say anything about anyone in particular that is the motto doesnt imply anything about your particular it doesnt say that everyone in some form of god only that the nation on the whole does we have been through this before its obvious it does not include me this much is beyond doubt your claim again is that the motto to more than based on the that all other are wrong and because it that the motto was written by i doubt your claim so you are saying that all must believe that all other should be just because they think they are wrong thats silly i think the are wrong but i dont advocate their banishment based on this idea i doubt that any additional expense would even be by removing the motto provide some evidence for your claim that it would i think that any such cost would be insignificant i the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency the digression of the other it is used for harassment and no other purpose been found for it why should it not be removed well in general dont really have i dont think it should be removed because i think the benefit would be by the and do you know what the vote was were there other do you think that the main reason the motto was by law was to bother do you think that this is what the majority of congress at the time had in mind if you do then show why again it is the opinion of the people who put it there that i am concerned with then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress again it is not necessary that the complete majority the purpose of godless communism with this motto why not it is the majority that put it there the general public probably does not know about the antiatheist intent of a few people in the either i daresay more people remember the than the time when key wrote the anthem but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against why dont you include this in your little survey that you were you claim here that would believe i doubt this provide evidence for your assertion what should i ask some the probability that something said about relativity is worthy i mean if said it theres a good chance that it was right at least at the time as for the the method use can be applied i need not agree with the court by default because of a good record you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think that their would be good evidence in favor of some point what but you said you didnt agree with the court because they congress to attempt to make an amendment flag burning if you dont realize that something like this is external to the realm of the power then how can i be confident that you know anything about the i mean if you dont know how the court works how can you participate in a discussion of the court a judge can go to speak before congress and still you ignore the abortion gag rule as you make your on abortion no i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court justice to testify before congress during the consideration of a constitutional amendment and in order for the court to rule on something a case usually must be whatever the analogy is the same just because something that i might find offensive is present doesnt mean that my are being we are talking about something put there by people a mushroom no one that mushroom to exist unless finding offensive in a mushroom farm yes some can be and i dont appreciate on my pizza either this is not the case with the motto and the harassment which is the only known result of the motto and that somewhere along the line people were forced to put the motto there who was forced to put the motto there what do you mean',\n",

bow to the will of corrupt and evil secular this disobedience brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from their and it is significant to remember that these secular were by average people and that at the time almost all were pretty it was largely the disgust at such as polygamy which in their irrational hatred true but that is exactly the problem the mormon extermination order was not just by a it was under the constitution of the united which was precisely to prevent like this order from in the first place as i in an posting your irrational hatred is clearly by like

a neat justification which critical thought true as by numerous as i am sure aware in any regard mormon history alone that secular and i dont even discuss how were into part of their in becoming and atomic bomb testing grounds is far from being or righteous have really for the better i may be a born cynic but i have no reason whatsoever that such been the case in the early i believe the late

them thar and what about the majority of who arent you seem to be searching for enemy correction the majority of are mormon i believe up to a in many and throughout the western it is paranoid to believe that everything that you badly must have been done primarily for that purpose what i mean is that secular are to be watched as we believe that satan been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth judgment and justice in addition we believe that the adversary power to influence the unjust and idolatrous greed for money would be a good example in order to bring about persecution war oppression and evil as an intelligent being dont you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power as far as is concerned what i pointed out were some horrible of environmental upon by secular which have brought death disease ie the and environmental nation i am hardly paranoid i am just not too much from a secular government that may not share our and faith and which indeed as al may be out to harm and destroy us as a matter of fact in my church indicate that in future global persecution against will so increase in intensity and scope that all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to the pure in heart will be in those days and it aint our current secular who will rule over it did not pose a great threat to the federal or the security of this nation and with i too wonder who or whats next i personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the life of even one person sure he did not pose a threat to the security of this nation but he did pose a threat to the of his that much is definite definite by whom until such been established beyond reason able doubt this threat may have

for your reading pleasure ill post a couple of these a day unless group that i stop or i run out of good material i havent been particularly careful in the past about saving i think the following comes from a but someone correct me if wrong this is probably the of my entire collection so that the prophecy be in considering the religion and it according to its it is important to look at its at prophecy the scribe is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he are prophetic in the career of of as you will see main strategy is to take various old testament often not even about the and apply them to the in the new testament we must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the since the were written at least after was executed we do not know how much exactly as stated but for of analysis we will take particular at face value we begin of course at the beginning mary will bear a son and you will name him which is salvation for he will save his people from their all this to what the lord had spoken by a prophet in the days of c king of of and of made war on of but could not quite conquer it when the house of ie and his court in were told of this its heart and the heart of its people shook and the lord said to go to meet with and the lord spoke to through prophet naturally saying ask a sign of your lord it can be as deep as or as high as heaven but said i wont ask i will not put the lord to a test then said hear then o house of is it not enough for you to weary men that you must weary my god too therefore the lord himself will give you a sign behold a young woman is with child and will bear a son and name him which is with us he will eat and honey when he how to refuse evil and choose good for before the child how to refuse evil and choose good the land of the two you dread will have been deserted in on just the sentence that is in italics further he the word young woman as specifically virgin but this is not a prophecy about the it is not a prophecy about an event to happen later it is not a prophecy about a virgin mother in short it not about made use of a verse out of context and to make it fit the specific case of mary it should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be made to fit mary mary virgin or not was indeed a young woman with child of course the fit is shady and while thought of by later to be walking among men was never by the name if wished to claim this prophecy for it becomes at best a prophecy a second class prophecy not too convincing after birth in about a quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to as if he to liken to this was done to escape an infanticidal rampage of the king and there until the death of this was to what the lord had spoken out of i have my son what the lord really said was this when was a child i him and out of i my son the more i them my people the more they went from me they kept sacrificing to the and kept burning incense to conveniently the rest of oracle but it was indeed that once out of to return this is history is certainly not being spoken of here and if we are to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a that and again this prophecy is just not as convincing as probably had hoped weeps while is off in that king sought to kill him and thus ordered the of all young male then by this that which was spoken by the prophet was a voice was in and loud lamentation weeping for her she to be because they were no more the reference is to a passage in to the carrying off of into exile by of in the ancestor of the major of and is said to weep for her who are no more it is metaphorical of course since lived and before the were even in the exile it is interesting to note that it was not who was the ancestor of the the land where and were if anyone should do weeping for her it is the only connexion that with is that the have it that she was buried north of the city on the way to as for and his infanticide it is rather unlikely that such an event actually one never but the event is not or to anywhere else in the nor is it in any of the secular of the time was particularly unliked in his reign and many far less evil of were carefully this might be a prime example of how were added to life to enhance the message of the gospel because of the whole similarity to the tale of the infant in it is highly likely that it is a device set up by to add prophetic yet artificial approval of it is not surprising that conveniently to mention the rest of the quote the the prophet of are not dead but in the empire the weeping saying that the will be returned he will gather them back together of course this would not suit purpose as the he of are dead for good again the prophecy up is not even that and to anyone who to check it out is not too convincing the we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another prophecy after leaving wife take the infant to live in the city of that what was spoken of by the might be he shall be a first thing we notice is that does not mention the name of the this time second we have to ask who he is there are no speaking of a worse there are no period a still worse there are no in the old testament at all in the book of an angel mother that she will conceive and bear a son no razor shall tough his head for he will be a to his god from the day of his birth he will deliver from the of the this is of course not a prophecy of or the of but it is the best that can be found obviously begun to go overboard in in that he is simple making them up now bearing our next goes around healing people of physical and this was to what was spoken by the prophet he took our and bore our as the verse in is out of context and a few are skewed to fit the scheme we have is surely he the suffering servant borne our sickness and carried our from a reading of the surrounding in we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of chosen servant and people he to the suffering in exile in the voice of the gentile that look upon it this image is deeply ingrained in identity an image of a yet as the instrument of the salvation by the speak of taking on the which are the literal and metaphorical of guilt and discipline they do not speak of a servant going around and healing people notice that the servant in on the and of the and individual as we all know did not take the onto himself the here in are not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that had already while it is that took on the eternal punishment of hell he did not bear the he so while someone might want to say that figuratively the of in his spiritual atonement he to admit that parallel where he intended it to have its effect silent upon healing of it is said that ordered them to keep quiet presumable so that he wouldnt arouse the attention of the local this was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved with whom my soul is i will put my spirit on him and he will announce justice to the he will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets he will not break a reed or quench a wick until he justice to victory and the will hope in his name the passage is behold my servant whom i uphold my chosen in whom my soul i have put my spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the we will not cry or lift up his voice or make it in the street he will not break a reed or quench a wick he will faithfully bring forth justice he will not fail burn dimly or be until he established justice in the earth and the await his law you see conveniently left out part of the passage because it does not suit the of could never think of failing never would the light of mankind burn dimly but the servant nation of will indeed come to an end when its job is done when the come to embrace there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will be the of also the ending phrase been from the the await his law to the the will hope in his name while the original the torah law of the other it to fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name if one any doubt the servant to is not one only to read the whole chapter and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant a people and so we see that when attempt at prophecy is it three days and three nights now we come upon a prophecy supposedly by the very mouth of the god himself he of his crucifixion and resurrection for as was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights before any further discussion can occur it is necessary to know how the understood days as far as day went each was long lasting from sunset to the following sunset what was to as a day was the period of light from to the ending sunset at thus according to our time scale a sabbath day at evening and until evening this is why the celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of instead of it like a real miracle that didnt forget that was indeed the seventh and last day of the week thus when days and nights are to together hour daylight and hour night are being spoken of thus that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise for three days and three nights as the good book us was crucified on the ninth hour which is afternoon he then was put into the grave sometime after that then left the grave rose before dawn of what we call the dawn after the sabbath was over what this is that was our time for clarity in the grave from night to some time before morning we could also add a little time before since the is not specific here what this time is that he was in the grave for one day two nights and possibly a couple of of one day certainly this is a problem for prediction there is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights even modern time we then are led to suspect that this error is another one of little and that the gospel writer put false into his mouth and no matter who made the prediction it is more than unconvincing it is hearing understanding tool on a habit of speaking to his vast in in which a meaning could be found if you were already one of the elect those chosen to understand the message of he that those who can understand the are the he if the people cannot understand them there is no need to bother with them since they will not accept the plain message any better with them the audience indeed in the prophecy of which you will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive because this heart grown dull their are heavy of hearing and they have shut their so the they would not perceive with them her with their and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them the original are part of his works his call to the ministry this is in when is flourishing right before it under the authority of the good times ending and also a vision from calling him to bring reform to and is and said go and say to this people hear and hear but do not understand see and see but do not perceive make the heart of this people fat make their heavy and shut their so they will not see with their or hear with their and understand with their hearts and turn and be then said how long lord and he said until the lie waste without inhabitant and without men and the land is utterly desolate and the take men far away and forsaken are many in the land and though a tenth will remain in it it will be burned again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still when the tree is the holy seed is its stump here we see that it is really who the people of to stop listening to the but the promise made to and if you read the rest of you find that this is done to the plan of to use as a servant a light to the look at we see that just a little portion of verse to suit his own gospel needs more than that he the to make it fit the people who didnt understand and as we see are not but rather from to him in the present once again prophecy flat on its face again to make look like they have the prophetic approval he said nothing to them without a parable this was to what was spoken of by the prophet i will open my mouth to them in i will utter that which been hidden since the foundation of the world really up here he to quote not from a prophet but from the i will open my mouth in parable i will utter dark of old that we all have and known that our have told us we will not hide them from their but tell to the coming generation the glorious of the lord as was pointed out the in the do not really come from a prophet you might also want to know that of gospel even inserted name as this prophet apparently later caught the error and tried to cover some of it up perhaps the most significant part of this is that once again the old testament as said he in so that some will not understand them the in the are not to be hidden further they speak of known that our have told us with hidden since the foundation of the world indeed dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion this is in direct opposition to the in the no wonder had to rewrite them and still once again artificial fall flat on their face but rarely look at this arent the only about that are beginning to look bad of little faith in we see that the are able to go around casting out except in one case not knowing what epilepsy was the people thought those with the disease were with it is no wonder that the were unable to dispossess the epileptic but perhaps no more enlightened than they is to have them saying they didnt have enough faith this strange why was this demon special it that either a true believer faith or he does not apparently enough faith will allow someone to move of course you will find no one these days that can move real no one the only the can speak of are those to happen on to or some faraway place major are making some old arthritis feel better on morning and the are always shrouded in ancient lore and from the in their sacred they are either dead sleeping or in heaven with people about their imminent return and their great of days long gone yet life goes on tales of of all in a distant time or a distant place used to reveal themselves to men in the old days too but now they are silent all the give are various as to why we dont get to see god were too lazy were not zealous enough were sinful its just his plan we put too many of our own on appearance if we had the right faith if we were willing to meet on his yet even the most pious of men have not seen you dear reader have not seen not literally you know that to be true i know thats presumptuous and bold but searching your heart you know what i mean all that weve seen do is make people feel good and content about not seeing they say our little faith does not merit us to see sometimes they say see the love in these people you worship with see the of people change that is seeing thus people get to sleep satisfied with turning into the everyday but that is not seeing as i am speaking of it is not seeing the way people used to see what we see in the world that is good is the compassion of human hearts the love given and taken by men and the forgiveness by atheist alike beauty by the mind of man these are the that are done these are what we see but it is said this is so only because everybody little faith on an ass shortly after the role of the king a donkey be brought in for him to ride into this took place to what was spoken by the prophet saying tell the daughter of behold your king is coming to you humble mounted on an ass and on a of course the passage from a little differently lo your king comes to you he is triumphant and victorious humble and riding on an ass on an ass colt he will command peace to the there all that much difference here except that only one animal an while the poetic wording slightly differently thus he call for both a colt and an adult ass from version we get a comical picture of the divine sweating it to straddle two this could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma we find that in the account written by st mark only the colt was for and brought to this indeed the of properly and us that in attempt to use prophetic he now excluding many respectable i have met i have that while is thought to have ridden on the situation is often reversed nowadays then entering the temple the were at people and calling the but as we might expect to have done havent you read out of the mouth of and thou brought perfect praise it is more likely that made this response up since was never one to point out such little prophetic and since as we might expect the quote is in error which to fit track record quite well we might ask or havent you read for the source o our lord how majestic is your name in the whole world you whose glory is above the heavens by and you have a bulwark against your to still the enemy and the avenger the hardly need comment there is no perfect praise spoken of in the psalm and what praise is there is given to not his king and not as it to be just one more case of pen making up convenient prophetic scripture said to my lord is said to have from whom the is to be the agree it is king but then by the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your under your taken at face value is the necessity of descent one he is in opposition to their answer of course the answer is that he but is trying to make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the its tempting to believe this if one is a and not interested in of investigation but there are in time the psalm was thought to be about the and it is easy to see why might refer to the as his superior we need only look at the about the to see that he is to be a great king the to times even better than those under rule of course the listening had no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine such as the worship the problem in the meaning of this psalm an error that apparently several of time had also made one must remember that there were various among the often as a result of different of the was apparently one of these like his audience who thought the was imminent and who among as being what is the problem then psalm literally utterance to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your your footstool forth your mighty scepter from rule in the midst of your your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy you are a priest of the order of forever the word lord is often mistakenly by to denote divinity in this lord but in the the word is and no simply lord a generic term as we would use it it is used often in the to refer to and to it is merely an address of respect there is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word either to divinity or to the that this is supposed to be written by is not certain the title of the psalm to either a psalm of or a psalm about it fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet about covenant and endorsement from if the psalm had been written by it is unlikely that he would be talking about the the idea of a perfect king from was not present in age we have extensive tales of doings and none of which include any of a many of the show evidence of being written long after was dead in times of the exile when had put his show of for kingdom on hold the description in the psalm fit very well was by a rise to power victory over his successful among the he he the priesthood common to in being a righteous king to bless the people it all we do not have to blame this problem on alone though here there is not artificial prophecy to though his use of the scripture is rather questionable still this event is common to the other too so we let off a little more easily this time it is interesting to note though how up the event the gospel of mark the tale with simply speaking to a crowd the who the religious competition of an infant be the target of question as we might expect that the event up by embarrassing the such power is the pen had it together all along we leave the gospel story of momentarily to see a in gospel the gospel story of special treatment because it to be so far removed from the real of career as told by even but for the moment we will just look at one verse the early church a religion on the of a king and on an artificial extension of the original made by when the history of wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the people while this was accomplished eventually under the rule of king the who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise but to do so they expanded on the promise preaching about a heavenly kingdom speaking your father to see my day he say it and was glad it would be nice to tie in approval for from but knew nothing of or a or anything i have tried and to find any event in the old testament which to little prophecy it is par for the course to see st making up old testament just like his forerunner many know that their faith many of its in such fraud and it is surprising they still cling to it the field we are told that was while in by one of his and throwing down the of silver in the temple departed but the chief taking the silver said it lawful for us to put it in the treasury since it is blood money so they bought a field with it to bury in then was what was spoken by the prophet and they took the thirty of silver the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of and they gave them for the field as the lord directed me this prophecy is an utterly gross of old testament scripture first made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet it is who the which use of and they weighed out my wages thirty of silver then said to me cast them to the treasury the lordly price at which i was off by them so i took the thirty of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of first of all the of do not deal with a betrayer of the or of the deal with a shepherd most likely a priest chosen to serve a function of over the people shortly before would send and into conflict with one another the word treasury had been by the king with to the potter precisely because this made quote fit better but this is a blatant error the correct translation of the is indeed treasury which also perfect sense in context whereas field is totally unrelated whether the mistranslation was intentional or not to be beyond speculation however given track record one it hard to resist the notion of intentional of course would have ample reason for the text the thirty of silver match situation and if as most seem to be the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity might have another prophecy to toss around however the correct translation of directly the situation with and the high the high would not put the money in the treasury the worthless shepherd of does exactly the opposite of course to the average student the prophecy as by would be taken at new testament face value to those work is convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots then is led away to be crucified they gave him vinegar to drink with gall but when he tasted it he would not drink it and when they had crucified him they divided his among them by casting lots that it might be what was spoken by the prophet they parted my among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots first of all the vinegar to is actually common sour wine of the type that drank regularly we find that right before the themselves give him some to drink not polluted with gall said i thirst a bowl of vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and it to his mouth when he had received the vinegar he said it is finished but to be drawing on not a passage from the but one from the i for pity but there was none and for but i found none they gave me poison for food lit they put gall in my meat and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink add to them punishment upon punishment may they have no acquittal from thee let them be out of the book of the living of course the sour wine to is done at his request of drink this does indeed seem to be a show of pity the psalm is about and his political and military it is not about the or it is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the in the psalm for the damnation of the whereas the of the said father forgive them the dont know what they do further with his attempt to create prophecy by gall a bitter substance put into drink not his meat as the psalm with the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask what of the casting of lots this up the psalm which discussion all by itself suffice it now to say that the fact that clothes were divided as told is no great thing it turns out that this often to any felon in those days as we will soon see it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to it does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of clothes for a man so removed from worldly his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots some the psalm this psalm is to as a lament of his condition under the attack of his it becomes a song of praise to and of hope taken out of context of it seem to fit the plight of at the crucifixion quite well we will examine the primary verse my god my god why have you forsaken me why are you so far from helping me far from the of my groaning oh my god i cry by day but you dont answer and by night but find no rest is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross this that the whole psalm is really about rather than king of course the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to or his execution is not pictured as about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like the lamb led mute before its indeed doesnt do much groaning even when on the cross he certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross but i am a worm and no man scorned by men all who see me mock at me they make and wag their he his cause to so let him deliver him for he in him this to fit execution pretty well with the exception of the holy being a worm many encompass me they open their widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion yea dogs are round about me a company of encircle me they have pierced my and i can see all my they divide my among them and cast lost for my raiment but you be not far away deliver my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflicted soul from the of the wild bull it would seem quite convincing and sure the early who wrote of this prophecy thought so too unfortunately this prophecy a fatal flaw the have pierced really do not exist in the psalm the correct translation is yea dogs are round about me a company of me like the lion they are at my and in the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character the word in the text is literally like the lion which sense in the context and even further the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer it is convenience that would urge a to change the word to but to add the yet artificial weight to the prophecy this is just what the have chosen to do while the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from to its absence does not say much for the honesty of the apart from the erroneous verse the psalm does not lend itself to so easily verse of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross this naturally the true subject king as a side note we now know that did not pierce the the but rather the this doesnt say much in of the traditional thought of a showing his the on his but then arent bound by our religious culpability this time as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord but the psalm like many was on the of all the gospel when they the and of life and death how much these may have to what actually got written down is a question that serious for theology it is easy to see for those who are not faithful how some of the in the new testament might have been enhanced by such as the eager but it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural and prophetic so far this not said good for st the reference to the piercing a lot like crucifixion gospel recount written about after the fact us at execution but one of the pierced his side with a spear and out came blood and water these took place that scripture be the will look on him whom pierced of course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context prophet us how much of the nation of will split off from and and go to war with them and will give victory to and on that day i will seek to destroy the that come against in and i will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication on so that when they look on him who they have pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a child attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps that at least usually more than just one passage are grossly obvious and blatant here it does not speak well for any of the gospel as it to show how the prophetic of their religion were with after his arrest is quickly executed for the kingship according to one version of the gospel tale executed along with two and with him they crucified two one on his right one on his left and so the scripture was which he was with the here mark is trying to link to a passage in about the servant nation of the passage is not about the for if one the whole chapter of and its surrounding one that the servant is a nation the are also about what this servant gone through in the past not a prediction of what is to come in any event the servant is thought of as a criminal this also to fit the description of had the passage really been about the it still is not at all clear why between two would fulfill the prophecy in would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry he was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that mark could have had made a better analogy with general mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with also him this is to be from a couple of of course in his later recount st luke to change some luke us and one of the who was with him arent you the save yourself and us this certainly with recount which how the people who crucified said save yourself and that the did the same but then luke goes on but the other criminal the first saying dont you fear since you are under the same sentence of condemnation and we indeed justly so for we are the due reward for our but this man done nothing wrong and he said remember me when you come in your kingdom and verily i say to you today you will be with me in paradise now this little dialogue highly it the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech we have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering such a man apparently noble and of principle doesnt seem likely to have been a robber we wonder at the amount of theatrics by luke of course recount also with luke only one criminal revile not both it is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free of do not have this avenue open this is yet another example of a writer trying to take an old testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology in this case the embroidery some embarrassing as we have seen the end of the world now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing in the new testament it is found in all three of the synoptic gospel and some of the most doubt on the whole theory of the destruction of the and and his ask him about this and about the end of the world which he been warning about the tell us when will this the destruction be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age take care that no one you astray for many will come in my name saying i am the you will hear of and of for this must take place but the end is not yet for nation will rise against nation all this is but the beginning of the they will deliver you up put you to death and false will arise and lead many astray but he who to the end will be saved this gospel will be throughout the whole world a testimony to the and then the end will come so when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet let those who are in flee to the immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be the will fall from heaven then will appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and all the of the earth will mourn and see the son of man coming and he will send out his and gather his elect learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as its branch becomes tender and forth leaves you know that summer is near so also when you see all these you will know that he is near at the very gate truly i say to you this generation will not pass away until all these take place but of the day and hour no one not the not the son but only the father therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect from this it is clear that thought the world would in within the of at least some of his he them that although he doesnt know the exact day or hour that it will come and thus they must be ready have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this holy error but unfortunately made himself to explicit he told his that their generation would still be around at the end and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be swept away there have been some who to removing the inerrant nature of the and said that the phrase this generation shall not pass away really this race of people will not pass away of course the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that the generation of the it is an interesting notion that when god decided to learn he didnt learn it well enough to make himself clear but it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the at least some of them are supposed to live to the end of the world the charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the it becomes abundantly clear from rev peter and rev that meant exactly what he said the end was very near for have this chapter of or its meaning altogether for they have for their executed leader to come back hearing of and of sure that he is coming soon surely he must be all we must do is wait can you imagine how tired he must be sitting around up there being holy waiting for just the right moment to spring so shortly after his crucifixion of it is said that after three days or three days and three nights or three of time or three eternal or three of whatever they can decide for less trouble he was seen again glowing with divine radiance then the decided it wasnt in the best of his new religion to stick around and therefore from sight into heaven so the story goes anyway as been seen there were many to when people got around to writing the gospel down to them was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture we have seen though that this matter is quite shaky but throughout church history have fast to faith in simple belief what doctrinal could not be with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away from question to question and investigate never been the easiest way to treat thus for the in the new testament have gone on largely accepted may well continue that way for some time a moment to consider the way the of have been accepted and used properly or improperly to support and persecution i suppose there is one prophecy of which can securely keep hold dont think that i have

large program like freedom or shuttle is at a center the center off a portion which goes into what to a slush fund this money is used to fund work the center manager to fund this sum is to be over a third of the funds think about that of the billion cost of freedom fully billion wont be spent on anything anything to do with space now maybe that billion was wisely spent and maybe it wasnt but the work done with it should stand on its own not the cost of other congress no idea of the of these congress never the term center tax they look at the station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it doesnt add up they wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money is going for something else my dear your fact and fiction here a couple of ago when i first read this in your posting i with one of the cost here in space station at headquarters if you wondering why i didnt post a response immediately i do have a real job supposed to be doing here at headquarters digging up old data looking into pretty low on the totem pole of priority also i spent last weekend in city at the national science association conference the of to science first off yes the concept of center tax or wrap does exist if i recall the correctly the total tax for the program for this fiscal year is around million this was by up the and center with the budget for this fiscal year at billion my the tax percentage is over the life of the program your figure of billion for the cost of a tax at a rate comes to million this is less than billion but i will concede its still an appreciable amount of pocket change i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at could be close to the actual rate the tax is only on funds that are spent at the center kind of like at some where you do have to pay tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you dont if you get it for example at the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the contract and are not subject to the center tax i dont have the in front of me but id guess at least of the funds go to so you could be right about a tax rate of but its only applied to funds spent at the center and not to the prime this to the obvious question what is the government doing with funds that dont go to the prime ie a slice of the billion pie a big portion of this slice goes to what to the balance of the funds which arent eaten up by the center tax at we call these funds we spend supporting development funds as they are supporting the development work done by we have used these funds to setup our own to the electrical power system architecture our a real life solar array field left over from solar cell research research a few back with car to simulate the on switchgear converter and data from the was used in a recent change evaluation about the stability of the power system we have also used the supporting development money to purchase nickel hydrogen which are on life testing at both lewis and the crane naval facility in as a side point of the battery on test recently hit the four year life test milestone have to the go through per year as a final example my home division at lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal and work for system analyses like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system availability a simulation setting up a with information on weight of the power system finally the money raised by the tax does not all go into a slush fund at lewis the director does control a small discretionary fund each year any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewis charter most of the tax however goes to fund the general at the center like the library the central computer division the contractor who the snow thus it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the budget doesnt go for to get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support which would be hard to compute by itself how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for year is billable to would you base it on the spend reading versus the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compare this estimate of the portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library who maybe on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal talk about a nightmare my last point is that i cant believe your claim that congress never of the term center tax unfortunately all of the testimony before congress on a computer so i cant do a simple word search someplace to prove you wrong but surely in some audit somewhere these cost were for congress',\n",

the meaning burial plot it the of and the various of plot of land and inheritance but nothing about chorion or burial plot why does this not surprise me thus it would seem to be a very good thing you archer as a reference later corrected himself from butler subject re new fallaciously date i owe the group an apology it is my habit to check my before and after their submission for in my last article i stated by the way you really should have in the index of your lexicon you would have found that the word in for lot is not chorion as stated by archer and nowhere in the very large discussion of in done the to theological dictionary of the new testament by is the meaning burial plot it the of and the various of plot of land and inheritance but nothing about chorion or burial plot why does this not surprise me thus it would seem to be a very good thing you archer as a reference i was wrong i admit that i do not have a handle on grammar and thus confused the second to last word in as being the plot of land in actuality it is chorion which is the last word unfortunately my dictionary does not discuss chorion so i cannot report as to the of the word i dont know if someone else would have caught this though i am sure that someone would be able to do so but i have an aversion to especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point my reply vary noble of you i didnt want to have to go to x number of to show you wrong although i am chorion a little of course the only other reference given is and such ridiculous that when i accused of actually believing he that i him and you maintain that you find such exegesis convincing oh dear my reply your of me are astounding read the beginning of this part of my response to see what i really said in my posting of this article actually you said that there was benefit to our argument in that it to to rediscover i did not realize that you would find such garbage beneficial unless you were convinced by it my reply thank you for correcting your of my and also these are not necessarily my they are we will discuss the land issue in later sure only to this one you have directed re because its enjoyable thus i apologize for thinking that even could find such should specify which of he convincing and quit behind a disingenuous mask of this is what not necessarily what i believe so which is it do you find the convincing or not my reply one of my in debating these with you and is to many different of possible raised by various and alike when i present my i will clearly distinguish them from now on of course without archer and we find that no at all and made a big thing about my not back to the actual thus we find this demand on his part for quality to be a hypocritical requirement my reply good point but in your that these are contradictory you have produced only superficial and nor have you dug glad you have begun in this post i will begin on these in more depth than i thought necessary as well it would be appropriate to look at what actually used as evidence now we know what he for a standard as he stated it often enough a the text itself b parallel c other pertinent d historical context e historical content f other pertinent historical g cultural context h cultural content i other pertinent cultural j grammatical construction k and word l but are these actual he used or simply empty hyperbole see he used a and since he is trying to reconcile it to other we see that he also used b on the other hand he no use of d historical context or e historical content or f other pertinent historical or g cultural context or h cultural content or i other pertinent cultural or j grammatical construction or even k and word remember archer and dont count thus we find his vaunted criteria for is just empty my reply question do you find such criteria important if so do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability or will you continue to present shallow i dont mean this in a bad way at this point in our i have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the i do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your re in and but i will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria since you desire me to i hope you will also it will greatly enhance our study of these the only thing he actually used beyond the passage itself is any other passage thus should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria to be a the text itself b parallel my reply the reason is are the you claim that the contradict one another i do not see the one another they may very well be complimentary as many scholarly mention may not be death as you claim but well look at your defense of this later also the reward of iniquity in the passage may not be the of silver in although you have a valiant attempt later at why you believe it is at this beginning in our we are laying some scriptural groundwork which will be expanded upon through exegesis of course the only reason i can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he done with death is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct my reply one of the i have given a different exegetical view of the is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these are complimentary however i see no problem in tony explanation of death how would you explain the inaccuracy between hanging himself in and falling headlong he burst open this question of the manner in which is one with which we are constantly in our many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two as an obvious irreconcilable error some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant is by these contradictory however this is not the case at all that himself while peter us he fell and was crushed by the impact the two are indeed different but do they necessarily contradict each other does not say that did not fall neither does peter say that did not himself this is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white both can be true and supplementary a possible reconstruction would be this himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that the valley of after he hung there for some time the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and fell down the ledge mangling his body in the process the fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this explanation this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of is from the bottom of the valley you can see rocky to in height and almost perpendicular there are still around the and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it is easy to conclude that struck one of the jagged on this way down tearing his body open it is important to remember that we are not told how long hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall a story of a man who was determined to kill himself this individual himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head he then the trigger and from the window at the same time on the other hand a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself while another could rightly he suicide by form the tall building in this case both are true as both are true in the case of and of the death of it is merely a situation of different of the same event your only reason for this is i believe your attempt to discredit inerrancy you havent related how this is impossible or highly unlikely what you said in an post tony rose there are still around the and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it is easy to conclude that struck one of the jagged on this way down tearing his body open it is important to remember that we are not told how long hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall the added text in this version is so heavy that assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics you should find it not credible but you seem to find tony eisegesis satisfactory while clearly here you discredit explanation based on what you deem too heavy for the but you havent why you feel that way you can say its a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction but that doesnt tell me it didnt happen nor have you shown why you reject that possibility is lying or is luke lying or are they both lying or are either or both of them why do you think there is such an contradiction i do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect at present though only two of me you claim and contradict one another in death i ask you again to provide evidence that stated in the hanging you claim that the of silver in that threw down in the temple and the chief used is the reward of iniquity in that in some way a field with therefore there is a contradiction prove that the of silver and the reward of iniquity are one and the same actually i find question to be a rather stupid request but i will answer it because he now himself to two first i would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life in fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone hanging except in fantasy cowboy and even then it usually to as an hanging my reply i work at an agency that child abuse and neglect today i got a call re a child that suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack he in his attempt and is in a psych ward at a local hospital hanging are not always successful to assume that because most are successful this one was also is begging the question if i may quote you last night listening to the answer man broadcast the research show one of the on there used several of these that you use i am not all that familiar with them the man on the bam show comparative religion and logic it was interesting this is so prevalent that so that to say a man hung himself with no other is synonymous with that he himself my reply are important at times as well see in an passage ill mention below does hanging always have this outcome did who is the only source we have re hanging himself state that as a result to say its synonymous it the same meaning as a boy age hung himself but he lived this is only one of probably of we can discover now i am not alone in this thought in fact since so scholarly opinion i did some research my reply thank you interestingly not one of the i read the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide my reply above mine so its to use to back your what about position do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility also is it possible that the you read may be wrong or lying or in other of their if so should we do as we have done with archer toss them to the side and not value anything they say their interpretation of the hanging of i am sure you would find some and maybe even some deception in those you also noted they the hanging as meaning he although that is very possibly true do you find that in the text itself remember thats the first criteria we must examine this included the knowledge commentary by woodward and my reply which i own its a good source of commentary but not inerrant the on volume commentary on the by the one volume commentary by j r word of the testament ralph earl the commentary by commentary by neal actually i could have many more as well my reply i appreciate your doing this research maybe we are getting somewhere in how we both should approach these more in depth study in each case these specifically describe that the interpretation of as successful suicide and thus i can only conclude that the word oneself is as a successful hanging my reply above mine no you cant only conclude this although as tony this was a highly probable outcome but does not state death as being a result the word is is its only occurrence in the new testament in the septuagint the translation of the used at the time of its only used in now when saw that his advice was not he saddled a donkey and arose and went home to his house to his city then he put his household in order and himself and and he was buried in his tomb notice that not only is it stated that himself sept but it explicitly and here we have no doubt of the result in we are not explicitly told also there is nothing in the to suggest success or failure it simply oneself but you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable that insist that the hanging was not successful my reply above mine reputable you mean that have never as far as that the hanging was unsuccessful that cant be done even by me as i said in an post although i still agree with exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding death taking into account several criteria recently some new in mat then he threw down the of silver in the temple and departed and went and himself but the chief took the silver and said it is not lawful to put them into the treasury because they are the price of blood and they together and bought with them the field to bury in therefore that field been the field of blood to this day first of all notice that the text does not say that as a result of hanging all it is that he went and himself luke however in us that and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails out this is a pretty clear indication along with the other given in speech the need to pick a new apostle that at least after fall he was dead so the whole concept that and luke both recount death is highly probable but not clear cut i also wrote my reply here we have a stickler that i have to say i just recently look at the passage in mat saying i have by innocent blood and they said what is that to us you see to it mat then he threw down the of silver in the temple and departed and went and himself mat but the chief took the silver and said it is not lawful to put them into the treasury because they are the price of blood mat and they together and bought with them the field to bury in mat therefore that field been the field of blood to this day notice verse and himself does not say does it should we assume he as a result of the hanging what does say act now this man a field with the wages of iniquity and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails out act for it is written in the book of let his dwelling place be desolate and let no one live in it and let another take his office here we may have a graphic explanation of my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth rethe two of death is doesnt necessarily explain how he does say himself but he didnt specifically say in the hanging incident however to show us his graphic demise therefore there is no contradiction between and re death my reply we do know from that he did himself and probably his death although its possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some thereby open i can no longer assume that to be the case therefore no contradiction did not say as a result of the hanging did he most believe he probably did but i all that to show that i highly regard the but in looking at the initially we cant assume it is however highly probable by the way while all agree that from the hanging the had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are one simply it entirely and simply back to version as the correct version in both and the knowledge commentary the hypotheses that hung and then when he his belly exploded which doesnt explain his headlong fall or that his branch or rope broke and he fell to his death and his gut out which doesnt explain how a hanging man would fall headlong rather than first my reply the outcome of any fall is dependent upon many high the person was suspended before the fall any such as tree that may have the fall how steep an incline of rocky the victim fell upon thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several in a superficial examination of the passage and the passage we are not given a lot of on the geographical but tony in the above post gave us some a possible reconstruction would be this himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that the valley of after he hung there for some time the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and fell down the ledge mangling his body in the process the fall could have been before or after death as either would fit this explanation this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of is from the bottom of the valley you can see rocky to in height and almost perpendicular there are still around the and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it is easy to conclude that struck one of the jagged on this way down tearing his body open now truthfully i do not see what is comforting about the source of the field prophesy but on the other hand the author is correct does make that confusion of course a who claim that every word of the is true by god will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of ie where the prophesy of the field came from my reply please when we are done with this study on his death remind me to discuss this with you as to your second question you ask how we could be sure that the money with which the land was indeed for the betrayal rather than some other source i would point out that in where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity it also specifically what act of iniquity they were talking about ie concerning who was guide to those who now i would point out that when the an act of iniquity and then immediately the reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one my reply we are getting somewhere arent we act and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the altogether the number of was about a hundred and twenty and said act men and brethren this scripture had to be which the holy spirit spoke before by the mouth of concerning who a guide to those who act for he was with us and a part in this ministry act now this man a field with the wages of iniquity and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails out act and it known to all those dwelling in so that field is in their own language dama that is field of blood act for it is written in the book of let his dwelling place be desolate and let no one live in it and let another take his office notice that in verse the word iniquity is not used rather it that a guide to those who but the writer did not stop for he was with us and a part in this ministry what part did play in their ministry this he said not that he for the poor but because he was a thief and had the money box and he used to take what was put in it for some thought because had the money box that had said to him buy those we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor so now we know what part he was a treasurer per se right after peter stated that a part in this ministry treasurer according to then luke the parenthetical explanation of wages of iniquity money that should have been put into the ministry but was stolen by to purchase a field i believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the wages of iniquity are what do you think now since i have given you clear and even perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of you are instead of me what type i think you are as you did to my reply i will gladly admit that i am a complete although i do not have that big a problem with the limited inerrancy view frank if one wished to with him he could not answer him one time out of a

by which the tradition and the corpus of the have been to us from the second half of the first millennium on this been their principal merit we can attribute directly to the magi the new formulation that dualism assumed known to us especially from and in part from the pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth ce according to this formulation the two of the dualism are no longer as in the beneficent spirit and hostile spirit but ahura himself and see ahura and this formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of and was most likely determined by the contact of the magi with the religious world in this new dualism which was that later known to the of and we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within to which we give the name see thanks to

frequently why does the shuttle roll just after the following answer and translation are provided by ken the ascent guidance and flight control training manual during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is until an sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is then the tilt maneuver roll program the vehicle to a down attitude to generate a negative which in turn structural loading other with this attitude are performance gain abort maneuver complexity look and crew view of the horizon the tilt maneuver is also to start gaining velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff target in second stage this really is a good answer but its couched in jargon ill try to interpret we wait until the shuttle the tower before rolling then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind by passage through the atmosphere the relative wind and the chord of the the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly negative angle a negative this a little bit of downward force toward the belly of the or the z direction and this force structural loading we have to be careful about those theyre about the most delicate part of the vehicle the new attitude after the roll also us to carry more mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didnt roll performance gain the new attitude the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort the return to launch site abort maneuver complexity the new attitude the ability for radio antennae to have a good signal with the radio antennae on the look the new attitude the crew to see the horizon which is a helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine the new attitude the shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east usually this the thrust from the to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction the shuttle to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit this all the question why the launch pad to give this nice attitude to begin with why does the shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude the answer is that the were from the days the shuttle two flame one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main engine exhaust you can see the effects of this on any daytime launch the exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the exhaust is fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the top side and the bottom external tank side of the stack the access tower and other support and service structure are all basically the same way they were for the a side note the also had a roll program dont ask me why a shuttle guy i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics he added that the roll maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw the roll component of that maneuver is for the stated the pitch component loading on the by keeping the angle of attack within a tight tolerance the yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination the total maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one array

but for the best speed you need an external card it will work without it but large take quite a while times as long to process thats a if you want it my favorite is interactive data language from research is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its language is very strong and easy very it the very well also personally i like doing the with on the or or even excel on the mac if its not too hairy then it over to image for the part i have yet to encounter any situation which that combination handle and the speed and ease of use to was incredible by the way its mostly astronomical

in for among them sun and and and quite possibly other by now i use the version the of several of grouped by function but all operating on a common disk file the tape io package is a set of utility

eight read from a common parameter file which must be in anyway in your default directory some will share and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit setting up a series of the standard environment a language very similar to basic but which you to the process of setting up for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility in i can also invoke independently from a command procedure theres also an optional library which you to write language which can interface with read to the data file parameter file the is designed specifically for but such a level of operator that once you reach the level where you can handle you can figure out ways to handle a few other as well for instance the tape io package a utility for reading what adobe on the raw data from tape in a number of different interleave this turns out to be ideal for the format would probably i havent tried handle and so on above all however you have to know what doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over its worth that the file is designed to contain not only raster image data but for map information via table and all manner of other information i observe that a image tape often all manner of information about the spectral latitude longitude time date of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the i believe that on the display is used on other than only a couple of specific display the name to come to mind one of my personal was a display program which would display directly from a file to a display subsystem could be in your case it designed for the very high end ie those for whom a largely doesnt suffice although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time its probably no coincidence that is in canada a country which does a lot of its management via remote i believe the government for some of its work in these spectral analysis manager back in something spectral analysis manager which got a fair amount of use at

disease nor is he responsible for the of what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve without into a deep discussion of creationism evolutionism god the original genetic code perfect and without flaw do you have any evidence for this if the code was once perfect and degraded ever since we should have some evidence in of this statement shouldnt we perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full of which are so because they intervene with the an impressive amount of evidence that are of very ancient origin it is likely that early early protein is the number of decreasing or increasing it that loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar structure in their on the other hand the possibility that have been inserted later several logical are removed by a splicing mechanism this would have to be present but unused if are inserted moreover insertion would have precise random insertion would not be since for removal of are besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace long terminal and target site and these are not found in or near i seriously recommend reading on molecular biology and genetics before posting theological like this try molecular biology of the gene or molecular biology of the cell for remember the question was in a theological context why does god cause disease in and my answer is likewise from a theological perspective my own it is no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective is by the evidence whereas theological often fail to this criterion i think you misread my meaning i said god made the genetic code perfect but that doesnt mean its perfect now it certainly since for the worse would you please cite a few that support your assertion your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence in fact it been that and are perhaps more important than weve thought for instance sex might have as defence against this view is by computer of evolution perhaps i thought it was higher energy like gamma and cosmic that most of the damage in fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action actually neither of us what the atmosphere was like at the time when god life according to my recollection most do not claim that life billion ago after all that would only be a half billion or so after the earth was it would still be too primitive to support life i seem to remember a figure more like to billion ago for the origination of life on earth anyone with a better estimate id replace with formed since there is no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one most recent of the age of the earth range between billion and of life not true but organic date back to billion this would leave more than billion for the first to evolve sorry i cant give any this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry i here dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer both and genetic although the of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code to more than offset this again do you want this be true or do you have any evidence for this supposed degeneration i can understand reaction excuse me but this is so farfetched that i know you must be jesting do you know what are do you know what point are do you know that everything can come about spontaneously in response to your last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you cannot know that i hope you dont forget this we have evidence that everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against this conclusion in science one does not have to believe in anything it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present own prior to this theology does not use this method therefore i seriously doubt it could ever come to right human being more complex to accumulate adversely affecting our and ability to fight off disease while the simpler of bacteria and tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is a bad combination hence we have that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial you are supposing a purpose not a valid move bacteria and do not exist to cause disease they are just another of a general principle of evolution only replication from we are just an efficient method for our to survive and replicate the less efficient didnt make it to the present and for the last time please present some evidence for your claim that human is degrading through evolutionary some people have that the opposite is true we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to degrade i havent seen much evidence for either claim but then i ask so where is this relevant to my discussion in question of why why are there genetic and why are there so many bacterial and viral which require to develop is it fault the original question i say no it is not of course nothing evil is fault but your explanation does not work it miserably you may be right but the fact is that you dont know that satan is not responsible and neither do i suppose that a powerful evil being like satan would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the that affect mankind i dont think so he could have done a much better job pun intended the problem is it no satan is necessary to explain any they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution did i say that where to me like another bad inference actually what youve done is to oversimplify what i said to the point that your summary of my on a new context i never said that people are meant presumably by god to be by getting why i did say is that free moral have if mankind to reject god as people have done since the beginning then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse in an universe i am not this if god i expect him to leave us alone i would also like to hear why do you believe your are indeed free this is an interesting philosophical question and the answer is not as as it to be what would you expect from oh i admit its not perfect yet but working on it a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point what does this have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which i provided an answer biology and genetics are fine and important scientific but they explain how god and set up life they dont explain the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution why is there a why behind and your proposition was something that is not by the evidence this is why we recommend these is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover evidence for this if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention as recent cosmological hawking al suggest why do people still insist on this thanks for your fine and sagely advice but i am not highly to learn all the of biology and genetics although sure id find it a fascinating subject for i realize that the do not change the big picture that god life in the beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its environment sorry but they do

me the hard evidence for my about his lack of objectivity are quite clearly in the book orientalism by said said by the way is a not a i think he is pretty much objective in his treatment in race and slavery in the middle east since he clearly between slavery under and the practice of slavery in other like the us prior to the civil war he also does not conceal that there are in the which promote the liberation of what he doesnt and i dont think nobody can deduce from these is that slavery will eventually be in now you might rather conveniently blame the practice of slavery on but the are out there i also fail to see the relevance of the claim of lewis being a to what i wrote regarding lewis him being a him a political motive for his giving and about read orientalism by said see the evidence for yourself in fact i may post some of it here if it too long they were information which anybody can access that slavery was at certain some after that this was the cause of in the empire between the slave and the government we also have in the library of on slavery where and concerning slavery all around the world can be found which i checked some of the lewis so i dont think political stance anything to do with documentary evidence i havent read article so i cant comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his in general so far that his political make him a writer on his polemics as i understand it are often quite subtle and are often based on telling again read orientalism by said i am not you to take what i say on trust in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get this book it is a book and check the evidence out for yourself the issue i raised was that were used for sexual when it was that sex i wrote that the prophet himself had i wrote an incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not want his concubine to get pregnant which is contrary to the notion that sex is for procreation only in other such are baseless in the and the if slavery is in reality as opposed to in the practice of some opposed by then for sexual is necessarily opposed too i seem to be in getting through to you is not slavery slavery was an institution in the century it advised on being freed for good which is nothing new many saw this as a good thing what is the problem here but i can argue rightfully that were about thinking about their politically the the good slave so obey your master and perhaps one day be free but it is very understandable that i do not communicate with since they assume the is from a god and i think it is a system on the society for preservation of the status quo are a part of this system the subordination of so that their function in society down to is a part of this system i understand your point of view i think rather it is us who are not getting through to you some of the you repeat above i have already before regarding i have made posting after posting on this subject showing that is not however have you been completely my or just missing them i just a very good one under the title and from if this already from your site then please me telling me so and i will you a copy of this excellent article your understanding of the issue of in is sadly deficient regarding my posting on slavery the second one i made which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year is based completely on the and numerous and to support its point of view our are different you are from a historical standpoint and i am directly from the of the and now just because people say they are and perform a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is part of even if it is opposed by the and no of course not let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you the drinking now if a person i am a and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now mean that that people should drink beer of course not and only an idiot would think so do you see my point it is very natural to think that the of the had no idea that the socioeconomic structure they were would experience at least two paradigm in in the western first with the end of the feudal era and the rise of commerce second with the industrial revolution well have and the status quo driven into misery trying to survive in a heathen world have economically they were unable to accumulate any wealth directly due to the economic in the in fact the rise of can easily be after the pyramid effect you do not produce any wealth at home but increase your wealth by conquering you are here on capitalist capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to their wealth this assumption is in opposition to to say is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist this does not mean that does not support a for it does in general but there are other of capitalism which are opposed to as i understand it when this stopped you and i were left bare in the open for to devour no capital no industry very poor social the education level in are the in the world the health statistics are miserable one can postulate numerous for this your theory is that it is because is not secularist and capitalist i will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your if you think as you obviously do that lack of education and power for a large part of history the world was very powerful for a significant section of history the world was the foremost in the so to say that is for example antieducation is completely absurd you try to blame this situation on history that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be other for this situation you blame for not following the but i blame for following the well your viewpoint on in me question the extent of your knowledge of i really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the are following the or not your idea is baseless from historical it is a poor utopia the world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage yet somehow in your theory it is by following the that are backwards in education it is your thesis that is for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which your theory while my are derived from social and economic history you have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it so far it to me that your view on being antieducation is quite contrary to history that you are so convinced of your me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this my solution to all is simple cut the crap i think you should consider taking your own advice get the straight here too and work hard to reverse the effects of of ignorance you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of but also of history particularly with respect to being of science till about or so i think yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history

the work involved and costing the work of the where and even some of the for the commercialization of space all as part of the work down the street is one of the commercialization they charge a fee you totally forgot the original post that you posted in that post you stated that the wrap was on top of and in addition to any overhead in this post you finally admit that this is not true now sure your a competent engineer but you clearly lack experience in several your show that you dont understand the importance of integration in large you also show a lack of understanding of costing as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental for everything this a flame a statement come your little down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration this is simply an ad attack and you know it your employer does charge a fee you may not see it but you do of course there is a fee it is for administration any organization but there is a heck of a difference in legitimate such as and other that must be there to support a program and wrap as you originally stated stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of down you say is not true which is it like they are it to their overhead rate go ask your costing people how much fee they add to a project i did they never of it but suggest that like our president did that any percentage number like this is included in the overhead well there you are as i said they simply include the fee in their overhead many the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer as you have posted on this subject you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a charge you admit here that this is wrong a line item budget every year i have seen it get some from that detailed budget and dig out the wrap and then howl to high heaven about it until you do that you are barking in the wind no you did not you merely repeated made by an employee of the overhead capital of integration overhead nothing that does could not be dont better or at the other where the work is going on integration could be done better at the integration was done here at and that did not turn out so bad the philosophy of is totally wrong there you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee there is no way that will ever work it never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on could you imagine a like set up for been the only agency working to reduce when was out a billion the you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem was the only place you would find people actually interested in the and building a station oh you are full of it on this one i agree that screwed up big they should be responsible for that screw up and the people that it to make a stupid statement like that just how deep your bias goes come to for a couple of and you will find out just how wrong you really are maybe not people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter what the are contrary to it funny it that someone who about a problem like this is at a place where everything is overhead when you have a bit more experience you will realize that integration overhead it is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort i agree that integration is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort what i disagree with is that integration function from the people that are doing the work it is leadership that is what made work final responsibility for the success of was by less than people that is leadership and responsibility there is neither when you have any organization set up as is you could take the same people and move them to or and they could do a much better job why did it take a year for to finally say something about the problem if they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place there is one heck of a lot i do not know but one thing i do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership i remember all of the turn over at that kept program in for do you it is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the problem lack of leadership from the white house congress and at is only a symptom of a greater national problem you are so narrowly in your that you do not see this why did the space news point out that it was the congressionally change that the methinks that you are being selective with the again the story you refer to said that some people blamed it on congress the fact remains that it is the you support so much who covered up the and wouldnt address the until the press the story are you saying the where wrong to get to address the you approve of what the did to cover up the no i am saying that if they were at it never would have in the first place if it four a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of million a flight then you pay billion a year you stated that your friend at said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year if the wrap were gone this merely out a in your that understandably you fail to see you should know that doesnt include transport for that comes from the shuttle budget what they where saying is that operational could be cut in half plus transport sorry gang but i have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going to have to do math for him for a while i will have little chance to do so i do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of to ask that the with be i have the time to one more that if the leadership that is at was on site at the problem never would have totally the lack of

worried about accidentally killing all of the time because our determination of who the enemy really is is imperfect then there is no way to win the war yes fortunately we have like your good self in power and it was therefore acceptable to slaughter or even of of in order to liberate we won the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian were way and for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media the are that less in the gulf war than did in any other war of comparable size this century this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical which were technically possible only recently the idea that of of is ludicrous not even of of and they were the being targeted or do you think that the us and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim either the smart didnt hit their and we know they did or they were civilian which is hardly to military potential the military mission are not they know they have to hit military to win a war civilian does nothing but unite the people against you not a laudable goal if one the people to rise up against their so some innocent people yes maybe the unarmed along that road didnt need to be bombed to perhaps that with half his face burned off and the little girl with the werent entirely guilty but its worth the death of a few to save the of the people it after all the may not have had a chance to vote for

all the innocent people who in in i dont hear you bemoaning them war is never an exact science but with smart its becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian sometimes are made are die thats war the way it really is but the alternative to allow tyrannical to treat the earth like its one big rummage sale everything they can get is worse like henry said some ago i know not what course may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one to stay free the death penalty was as a deterrent to crime but the legal that have been added automatic lengthy court have that purpose to a very small part of what it should be hence the question is do we instate the death penalty as it was meant to be and see if that crime or do we get rid of it entirely yes reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be all that about fair and a court of just in the way of justice give the police the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save ourselves the expense of all those think of the too la would never have had to spend so much money cleaning up after and holding showcase if the had been to do their job properly a quick bullet through the head of rodney king and another for the cameraman and everyone would have been saved a great deal of unnecessary and expense after all if the police decide a guilty that ought to be enough the fact that the death penalty been shown not to have any deterrent effect over imprisonment well thats entirely irrelevant your sarcasm is noted but you are completely here you come off sounding like a complete idiot although i feel sure that was not your intent so the war was wrong eh sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in eh i guess we shouldnt

the moon without sinking into the soil before this time it was feared by some that the moon was covered in great of dust which would not support a heavy landing vehicle surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a from to only surveyor and were unsuccessful the rest the first us to soft land on the moon taking of and scooping the soil for analysis landed from surveyor in and returned of the craft to earth surveyor the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which the crater region in viking and viking was from cape on august on a

color of its surroundings one thing learned was that sky was pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and out as far as its could image the viking kept until august when it ran out of propellant the lander was switched into a mode where it had been hoped it would keep through but after an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further communication was never again despite the through may of an interesting side note viking lander been the a mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the lander team the national air and space museum in is with the safekeeping of the mutch station

gave it the death star appearance the big surprise here was the stranger of the and were both unexpected and difficult to explain voyager thanks to heroic engineering and continued the mission to and

is of interest to you space are affected by numerous political economic and climatic as you probably know depending on just how far your interest in space will go you might also wish to join the planetary society one of the space in the world to planetary exploration their periodical the planetary report the latest space probe write to the planetary society north catalina avenue good luck

whatever sacrifice i need to make to break it then i do so there have been bad of mine that decided to put forth the effort to break and done so there have been other bad that decided are not worth the effort to break its my choice either way i am my own master i choose what i want to do i weigh the of my against their and i use my experience to help me deal with the unexpected which in turn make me more experienced i dont always succeed but i never fail either i learn do you have any you cant break why not for one you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the

insult people period its not in my nature and its not something that i want to do either are you truly the master of yourself not yet but my life is the ground i use to practice on the fun is in the getting there i have admitted that i am not the master of my thought life at all times that i sometimes say i do want to say and then repeat my mistake i have admitted to myself that i cannot control every aspect of my being there are times i know i shouldnt say something but then say it anyway there are times i simply forget a lesson i in fact am not my own master we dont start out perfect weve got to strive to be something better i know my and i know my and i live my life according to the i make and i am content to abide with the of my as easily as ill accept the praise for them there have been times in my life when made yes i try to never make the same mistake twice i need help me this help and i took him up on his offer i have willfully let be my master because what is better for me than i myself do i regard as a myth i feel that there are far too many people offering far too many of what he supposedly said and did the only person who can really judge me is me i choose the i travel and i decide whether or not i want to reach the end of any given road or turn back and as long as i dont always turn back theres no shame in it when i need help i seek out my do you see my point i think the one under the rock and getting a great tan out here in the sunlight my life since i abandoned theism come and join me it will be a difficult trip at first until you build up your for the long hike but its well worth it then i guess ignorance is bliss for you because you enjoy not a clue about the and you dont have a clue about what saying either open your and see open your and listen not just spouting off empty this is my life this is what me meaning dont you see not going to accept anything that i cant witness with my own or experience with my own especially not something as as what trying to get me to accept surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good reason to dont you can you witness motherly love with your how does and concern for you register with your if nothing to you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch then you better become a and fast you better get rid of your huh going way off the track here i say my mother me how do i know you ask i can point to definite done for me and i can even just bring her to you so you can ask her you say your deity you how do you know i ask you cant even convince me that it my god that you will not cease you have life forever you can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever or can choose to live it in paradise with god that is what my god and that was the issue your theism is what it up its wishful thinking if any god heaven before me like a carrot promising untold to me if ill only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just this once then i would choose hell i can not lie to myself to placate another being no matter how powerful it is note also that there are several trying to lure me this way ra please give me a solid reason to choose one of them over the description of why would you want to live a good life to you you die and thats it dont contradict yourself you have no reason to live a good life it doesnt do you any good in the end your life doesnt do anybody else any good either because everyone anyway so you have no reason to lead a good life leading a good life is meaningless why do you do such a meaningless thing that paragraph that you havent to a single word said have you ever gone to an amusement park why i mean after a few it and different except that a few lighter going to the amusement park doesnt do you any good at all why do you do such a meaningless thing the answer is that you think its fun you play the over and over because youd like to get better at it even though not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you blow ten on it you ride the roller coaster because its an thrilling experience even though because it the dickens out of you in the same way i think life is fun and i dont intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night d sorry i dont feel that sacrificing was something any god id worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case its not really all that important the resurrection sunk in is alive is not dead so you and your holy book say by the same token therefore every dont you see i have no reason to believe that what you say is true please give me some reason that i cant similarly apply to forget the for a minute forget forget about who said what about this

tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor along with look how precisely this cruise missile this building to most odd over here there was very little about the suffering of the until towards the end of the war and then it was confined to the few quality true at first the news media by all the new the military was not to mention the video from the as they in on their but later and especially after the bunker full of was hit they their tone it to me that they didnt have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare its like they were only as long as it was nice and clean smart dropping in on military but not when of dead dying and maimed up what naive how about all the innocent people who in in i dont hear you bemoaning them discussion about and all considered the and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore in the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied i should have said here militarily it from your below that you understood this as meaning morally i apologize what about the evidence that knew japan was about to surrender after but before is that another lie by the liberal media conspiracy i have often about this always thought that the first bomb should have been on island fortress of a good military target the second bomb been back for use on an industrial center if need be but i digress yes i have that we found evidence after the war that japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb unfortunately the military junta won out over the and the therefore the second bomb was most unfortunate i for one dont regret it nuke a jap for i dont regret the fact that sometimes military have to be made which affect the of innocent people but i do regret the which make those necessary and i regret the suffering by those why all the fuss about and not east timor or even tibet if is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of before we i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war it is evident that the west especially drastically but once and to militarily corner a significant portion of the oil supply he had to be stopped oh i see so we can overlook his chemical on of people but if he your right to drive a huge car well the go actually it was the fact that both that us and allied action if some backwater country took over some other backwater country we probably wouldnt intervene not that we dont care but we cant be the or if a coup had in instead of an invasion then we still wouldnt have because there would not have been the imminent danger to but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the oil us to take action a paragraph from here to later on if we to keep then it would have been appeasement right but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action or are you just setting up a strawman not setting up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow to keep diplomatic were ineffective i guess we shouldnt have fought either just think of all those innocent german in and yes do are human too you know sure what was truly unfortunate was that they in his grandiose quest for a thousand year the stemmed from that translation they were for it well in a sense yes they probably had no idea of what end would lead their nation to but what about those who didnt support of conquest its not as if they democratically for all his the got in the of and that was the last chance the german people got to vote on the matter they along with the rest why does this bother you so much the world is full of evil and are not perfect many suffer due to the wrongful of it it but thats there are no perfect i look forward to hearing your incisive about east timor and tibet what should i say about them anything in particular the people of east timor are still being by a dictatorship that their country hell even western have been all this was happening before the gulf war why didnt we send in the to east timor why arent we sending in the now probably because were not the of the world we cant police each and every country that to or invade another nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other that paragraph i whats your intent to sound like a loving well you arent doing a very good job of it well its not very loving to allow a or a to gobble up nearby and keep them or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain under their dominion so id have to say yes stopping was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest the government a policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization of people are rounded up tortured and executed amnesty international recently that torture is still widespread in china why arent we stopping them in fact why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them tell me how we could stop them and ill support it i for one do not agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it i agree that it is deplorable and as for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty yes amongst the i thought were theres an awful lot of white people in that jury so it was the on trial not rodney king surely its irrelevant on trial are supposed to represent a of the population are they or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is normally this is where the crime is unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order not an expert on law or even us law but it that this is the way the system is set up you can criticize the system but not have unfounded of racial prejudice thrown around and under law they deserved a jury of their you are saying that black people are not the of white people no not at all the point is that the fact that there were no on the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevant this point of allegedly racial is really shallow this idea of people only being tried before a jury of people just like them is really stupid should the have had a jury entirely made up of perhaps doesnt mean those who do the same thing like judge it people from the same station in life presumably because they are in a better position to understand the those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those certainly have no further than the video tape but the jury at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen when i see a bunch of beating someone lying on the ground its rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have been so its hard to imagine so when argument from incredulity acceptance from the revered author of a logical argument were not talking about a logical argument were talking about a court of law as the out some fallacious are not as in a court of law however you are this reasoning as part of your logical argument in this discussion this is not a court of law if the as the news them are true then i feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one were you not talking about the bias of the liberal media conspiracy the media is not totally monolithic even though there is a liberal bias such as the news hour try to give a balanced and fair of the news there are even conservative out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush i never used the word conspiracy i dont accept without far more evidence that there is some liberal conspiracy to take over all news thou shalt not kill unless thou a pretty good reason for killing in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who in the way as unfortunately it cannot be brown for loving thanks i like the quote pretty funny actually a python fan you know kind of in that vein of course any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already ha ha only serious i an atheist am against killing innocent people you a supposed are that its to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty as well hardly i didnt say that its a good thing to kill innocent people if the end is just unfortunately we dont live in a perfect world and there are no perfect if one is going to resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die i didnt say it is it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary i a moral relativist am that saturation of german at the end of world war was as far as i can see an evil and unnecessary act i would agree that it was evil in the sense that it much pain and suffering not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say that conclusion can only be at by all the involved and perhaps it was unnecessary as say we now know that doesnt mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didnt see it as being necessary rarely can one have full known of the of an action before making a decision at the time it may have necessary enough to go ahead with it but dont assume that i feel the was morally i dont i just dont condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult you moral relativism in the past are now that i am in no position to judge the morality of allied at the end of the war you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist i as an absolutist am in a position to judge but i defer judgment you are that the need to be assessed in the particular context of the time and that they might have been moral then but not moral now wrong they were neither moral then nor now they necessary to those making the to bring a quick end to the war i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision your love your absolute morality oh how quick you are to discard them when it you as stang would say would puke one day i will stand before and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum i understand the full of that and i am prepared to do so i dont believe that you can make the same claim and the reason i brought up the in was because you were bemoaning the civilian as being so deplorable yet blanket was because wasnt accurate enough to hit in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision was the norm so the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian that in spite of precision when so many more proportionately and quantitatively under the blanket in even with precision happen and some suffer but less in this war than any other other in history many went about their with minimal interference from the allied air the of of of civilian dead is just plain bunk yes bunk the us lost in over four and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting but we are to swallow that of of civilian in a war lasting about and with the allies the most precise ever

and say that many may not agree so what that is really irrelevant we do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line is truth regardless of popularity of also i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that and eternally existent are equivalent you say the mormon belief you cant grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been in order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant the that was the that is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the belief is that and were the same ra your point that we all are of and is also ra heretical since we are not innately and of ra we are adopted for ye have not received the spirit of bondage ra again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby ra we cry father and not the natural ra of god it is only through faith that we even enter the family of ra god for ye are all the of god by faith in ra and it is only through the manifestation of this ra faith in that we are become the sons of god but ra as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of

argument on the general quality of argument found is poor this article to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference concise logic us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not valid or invalid of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when or an argument note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable the matter is very much open for debate this document merely how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job or are the building of a logical argument a proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example it is or today is may be either said to be true or said to be false note that this is a technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning the proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of used to express it so god and there a god both express the same proposition an argument is to quote the python sketch a connected series of to establish a definite proposition an argument of three first of all the which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated these are the of the argument they are the evidence or for the argument and its or are often by such as because since obviously and so on the phrase obviously is often with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate into suspicious if something doesnt seem obvious to you dont be afraid to question it you can always say oh yes right it is obvious when youve the explanation next the are used to derive further by a process known as inference in inference one proposition is at on the basis of one or more other already accepted there are various of valid inference the at by inference may then be used in further inference inference is often by such as that or therefore finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which is on the basis of the and inference are often by such as therefore it that we conclude and so on the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference for example every event a cause premise the universe a beginning premise all involve an event premise this that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference therefore the universe a cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument a proposition can only be a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the do not make sense in isolation sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the might be stated first and the stated afterwards in support of the conclusion this is perfectly valid if sometimes a little an argument is much harder than or many people shower their writing with without ever anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument some look like but are not for example if the is accurate must either have been insane an evil liar or the son of god this is not an argument it is a conditional statement it does not assert the which are necessary to support what to be its conclusion it also from a number of other logical but well come to those later another example god you therefore do your duty to god the phrase do your duty to god is not a proposition since it is neither true nor false therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an argument finally causality is important consider a statement of the form a because b if were interested in a and b is as evidence the statement is an argument if were trying to establish the truth of b then it is not an argument it is an explanation for example there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start this is an argument my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine this is an explanation there are two traditional of argument deductive and inductive a deductive argument is one which conclusive proof of its that is an argument where if the are true the conclusion must also be true a deductive argument is either valid or invalid a valid argument is defined as one where if the are true then the conclusion is true an inductive argument is one where the provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion inductive are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other and about how probable their are there are of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive as they are often as the most rigorous and convincing it is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion this is because of the slightly nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully obviously a valid argument can consist of true however an argument may be entirely valid even if it only false for example all have premise are premise therefore have conclusion here the conclusion is not true because the are false if the were true however the conclusion would be true the argument is thus entirely valid more subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false as in all fish live in the sea premise are fish premise therefore live in the sea conclusion however the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true we can therefore draw up a truth table for implication the symbol implication a is the premise b the conclusion t and f represent true and false respectively premise conclusion inference a b f f t if the are false and the inference f t t valid the conclusion can be true or false t f f if the are true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid t t t if the are true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true a sound argument is a valid argument whose are true a sound argument therefore at a true conclusion be careful not to confuse valid with sound to delve further into the structure of logical would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy it is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major to be when an argument these are known as in everyday the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken as well as to the faulty reasoning that to those this is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument valid or convincing so for the of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when more closely by we aim to avoid being misled by them the following list of is not intended to be exhaustive ad baculum appeal to force the appeal to force is when the arguer to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion it is often used by and can be as might right the force need not be a direct threat from the arguer for example thus there is ample proof of the truth of the all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell ad ad is literally argument directed at the man the abusive variety of ad when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer the person or people making the assertion this is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those it for example atheism is an evil philosophy it is by and sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing for example that he is a known perjurer this is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not ad however it does not demonstrate that the testimony is false to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the ad see elsewhere in this list the circumstantial form of ad is when a person that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the particular for example it is perfectly acceptable to kill for food how can you argue otherwise when quite happy to wear leather this is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for the argument this fallacy can also be used as a of a conclusion for example of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing white this particular form of ad when one that adversary is a conclusion formed from selfish is also known as poisoning the well ad ad argument from ignorance this fallacy whenever it is that something must be true simply because it not been proved false or equivalently when it is that something must be false because it not been proved true note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it been proved true a basic scientific principle of course the is true nobody can prove otherwise of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist nobody shown any proof that they are real note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur for example a flood as in the would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth the earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the therefore no such flood in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something not we cannot conclude with certainty that it not however ad this is the appeal to pity also known as special pleading the fallacy is when the arguer to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted for example i did not murder my mother and father with an axe please dont find me guilty suffering enough through being an orphan ad this is known as appealing to the gallery or appealing to the people to commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people this form of fallacy is often by emotive language for example pornography must be it is violence against the must be true millions of people know that it is are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken ad this fallacy is closely related to the ad it of that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct ad the appeal to authority the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion for example newton was a genius and he in god this line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject for example we can distinguish quite clearly between hawking that black give off radiation and that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his on black hole radiation to be informed is a linguist so it is questionable whether he is to speak on the subject of machine intelligence the fallacy of accident the fallacy of accident is when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental mean that the rule is inapplicable it is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific for example generally dislike you are a so you must dislike this fallacy is often by and who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically general converse accident hasty generalization this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident it when one a general rule by examining only a few specific which are not representative of all possible for example was an insincere therefore all are insincere sweeping generalization a sweeping generalization when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization non pro post these are known as false cause the fallacy of non pro when one something as the cause of an event but it not actually been shown to be the cause for example i took an aspirin and to god and my headache so god me of the headache the fallacy of post when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it before the event for example the soviet union after taking up atheism therefore we must avoid atheism for the same cum this fallacy is similar to post it that because two occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other that may be the of the this fallacy when the are at least as questionable as the conclusion in this fallacy when one as a premise the conclusion which one to reach often the proposition will be so that the fallacy to be a valid argument for example must not be to hold government office hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job therefore will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail therefore cannot be to hold government office note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the conclusion an argument like the above actually been as the reason for the secret official ban on homosexual another example is the classic we know that god because the us so and we know that the is true because it is the word of god complex question fallacy of interrogation this is the fallacy of presupposition one example is the classic loaded question have you stopped beating your wife the question a definite answer to another question which not even been this trick is often used by in when they ask like where did you hide the money you stole similarly often ask loaded such as how long will this interference in our be to continue or does the chancellor plan two more of ruinous elenchi the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion of that an argument a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion for example a may begin by saying that he will argue that the of are undoubtably true if he then at length that is of great help to many people no matter how well he he will not have shown that are true sadly such fallacious are often successful because they arouse which cause to view the supposed conclusion in a more light equivocation equivocation when a key word is used with two or more different in the same argument for example what could be more affordable than free but to make sure that it remains free that can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely amphiboly amphiboly when the used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing accent accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning in this case the meaning is by which of a statement are for example consider we should not speak ill of our and we should not speak ill of our of composition one fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property by the of something must apply to the whole for example the bicycle is made entirely of low mass and is therefore very lightweight the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual is by a collection of those for example a car less petrol and less pollution than a bus therefore are less environmentally than fallacy of division the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition like its opposite it in two the first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its for example you are at a rich college therefore you must be rich the other is to assume that a property of a collection of is by each item for example can destroy a tree therefore this ant can destroy a tree the slippery slope argument this argument that should one event occur so will other harmful there is no proof made that the harmful are by the first event for example if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and well have a nation full of on welfare therefore we cannot legalize marijuana a is based on b is a type of these occur when one to argue that are in some way similar without actually in what way they are similar history based upon faith if so then the also a form of history is based on faith is based on faith so a form of are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so arent dogs a form of cat affirmation of the consequent this fallacy is an argument of the form a b b is true therefore a is true to understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given denial of the antecedent this fallacy is an argument of the form a b a is false therefore b is false again the truth table for implication it clear why this is a fallacy note that this fallacy is different from non pro the latter the form a b a is false therefore b is false where a does not in fact imply b at all here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduce anything about b converting a conditional this fallacy is an argument of the form if a then b therefore if b then a ad this is the fallacy of that something is right or good simply because it is old or because thats the way its always been ad this is the opposite of the ad it is the fallacy of that something is more correct simply because it is new or than something else ad the fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be right ad the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is this fallacy is the opposite of the ad ad this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is an ad is one that constant repetition in something bifurcation also to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation when one a situation as only two where in fact other exist or can exist many this fallacy when a questioner a simple answer to a complex question non sequitur a is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from which are not logically connected with it red herring this fallacy is when irrelevant material is to the issue being so that attention is away from the being made towards a different conclusion reification hypostatization reification when an abstract concept is as a concrete thing shifting the burden of proof the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition shifting the burden of proof a special case of ad is the fallacy of the burden of proof on the person who or the assertion being made the source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise straw man the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone position so that it can be more easily then to knock down that position then to conclude that the original position been it is a fallacy because it to deal with the actual that have been made the extended analogy the fallacy of the extended analogy often when some general rule is being over the fallacy is to assume that two different in an argument about a general rule a claim that those are analogous to each other this fallacy is best a real example from a debate about legislation i believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it such a position is odious it that you would not have martin king are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for black liberation how dare you tu this is the famous you too fallacy it when an action is to be acceptable because the

              " 'from singleton subject re and evolution organization of technology distribution world in article in article singleton deletion i will argue that your latter statement i believe that no exist does rest upon faith that is if you are making a positive statement that no exist strong atheism rather than merely saying i dont know and therefore dont believe in them and dont not believe in then weak atheism once again to not believe in god is different than saying i believe that god does not exist i still maintain the position even after reading the that strong atheism faith no it in the way it is usually used in my view you are saying here that driving a car faith that the car not saying this at all it no faith on my part to say the car because seen it drive done more than at in fact actually driven it now what does require some faith is the belief that my give an accurate representation of whats out there but there is no evidence pro or con for the existence or nonexistence of god see what i have to say below on this for me it is a conclusion and i have no more faith in it than i have in the and the argument used sorry if i remain skeptical i dont believe its entirely a conclusion that you have seen no evidence that there is a god is correct neither have i but lack of evidence for the existence of something is in no way evidence for the nonexistence of something the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation you personally have never seen a neutrino before but they exist the pink unicorn analogy down and is rather naive i have a scientific theory that the appearance of animal life evolution when i draw the conclusion that pink dont exist because i havent seen them this conclusion its foundation in observation and theory a pink unicorn if it did exist would be qualitatively similar to other known that is to say since there is good evidence that all life on earth from more primitive these pink would share a common with and and such god however no such correspondence with anything there is no physical frame work of observation to draw any from but first let me say the following we might have a language problem here in to faith and existence i as a maintain that god does not exist to exist to have being in space and time god does not have being god is being once said that god does not exist he is eternal with this said i feel its rather pointless to debate the so existence of god and that is not what doing here i believe that god is the source and ground of being when you say that god does not exist i also accept this statement but we obviously mean two different by it however in what i will use the phrase the existence of god in its usual sense and this is the sense that i think you are it i would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of god no thats a word game i disagree with you profoundly on this i havent defined god as existence in fact i havent defined god but this might be getting off the subject although if you think its relevant we can come back to it further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are more with it in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete making it a fallacy you are wrong here or perhaps you misunderstand what saying making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy not trying to convince you of anything i believe and that upon faith and it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm unless someone you that they can logically prove god or that they have evidence or then the use of logic to disprove their if fine and necessary an incomplete argument is not a fallacy some are not even wrong deletion one can never prove that god does or does not exist when you say that you believe god does not exist and that this is an opinion based upon observation i will have to ask what are you to there are no pro or con that are valid here in a positive belief deletion where does that follow arent based on the assumption that something i dont follow you here certainly one can make of that they didnt know i still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that god does not exist such a positive assertion a leap and wouldnt you say there is a level of definition that the assumption god is is meaningful if not i would reject that concept anyway so where is your evidence for that god is is meaningful at some level once again you seem to completely misunderstand me i have no evidence that god is is meaningful at any level maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of god down your throat i however am not doing this i am one and only one thing that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence

the only relevance here is that you dont seem to be able to tell us what capital punishment actually is and when it is murder that is when you tell us murder is wrong you are a term you have not yet defined well said that when an innocent person been executed this is objectively a murder however who is at blame is another question it that the entire society that any of realizing the to blame there is a probability of killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air and there is a probability of killing an innocent person when the state a system of capital punishment so when you do either you know that they you are taking will sooner or later result in the killing of an innocent person yes but there is also a that you will kill someone doing any activity presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this and driving will kill people as will but people continue to do both driving and flying are not on unwilling by they are that we take upon ourselves willingly and i argue that our law system is a similar risk perhaps an innocent person will be someday but we work to prevent this in fact many go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of if our own driving someone else then sure there is a moral issue i know at least one person who was involved in a fatal accident and they felt guilty afterwards but such are to be totally given the of on the road again the blame is on society no not this is what you said you were saying that if there were such a false witness that in an innocent person being and it would still be the fault of the state since it did the actual killing no i just that the state does the killing it does not depend on there being false how could it the state does the killing even in the case of sincere yes but the state is not at fault in such a case the state can only do so much to prevent false it is possible so what are you trying to say that capital punishment is always murder because of the of human error the system saying capital punishment is murder period not because of this that and the other but because it taking human life thats my definition of murder i make no to or to objective morals so this is what you call murder but the question is whether or not all such are wrong are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong no matter what the if we as a society decide to murder someone then we should say that and our for doing so and live with the moral we should not play word and pretend that murder murder and thats my opinion about how society ought to be run but this is basically how it works society the risk that an innocent person will be by execution and every member of society this blame and most of murder include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an execution is it but we were trying to discuss an objective moral system or at least its what does your personal system have on an objective one no we were not an objective moral system i was showing you that you didnt have one because for one thing you were incapable of the in it for example murder murder the golden rule do not because by it at all society implicitly the no matter who the innocent victim is were not talking about reading we are just talking about knowing the truth yes we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but the court work on a principle of knowing the truth beyond a reasonable doubt sorry but you simply are not yourself accurately here is what you said and since we are looking totally objectively at this case then we know what people are thinking when they are voting to execute the person or not if the intent is malicious and unfair then the execution would be murder what you are doing now is to slide into another claim which is quite different the jury being persuaded beyond a serious doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their beyond a serious doubt reading the of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not but in an objective system only the absolute truth and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth that is twelve must be convinced of a truth moreover a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence that you and i would laugh at but then if we read the of these people we would know that the conviction was unfair but would it be perfectly fair if we could read if we assume that it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth why is it so much less fair in your opinion if we only have a good approximation of the absolute truth its not a question of fairness your claim which i have above is a claim about whether we can know it was fair so as to be able to distinguish capital from murder yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we cant always determine the difference in our flawed system i think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still objectively perfect you see it doesnt matter if we know it is fair or not objectively it is either fair or it is not now theres a huge difference if we can read we can know and if we cannot read we can know nothing the difference is not in degree of fairness but in what we can know but what we know no effect on an objective system i think it is possible to produce a fairly objective system if we are clear on which it is supposed to promote not going to waste my time trying to devise a system that i am pretty sure does not exist why are you so sure i simply want people to confront reality my reality remember why is your reality important in this case the reality is that ideal apart we can never know even after the fact about the fairness of the justice system for every innocent person from death row there may have been a dozen innocent people executed or a hundred or none at all we simply dont know but we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely and you realize that the correctness of our system nothing about a totally ideal and objective system now what are we going to do on the one hand we can pretend that we have an ideal theory and that we can know we can never know and the system is fair and that we can wave a magic wand and make certain of killing not murder and go on our way well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal we can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible on the other hand we can recognize that all justice a small we hope probability of the innocent and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic of the we set up and then say well here we go murdering again maybe some of us will even say gee i wonder if all this is strictly necessary yes we all bear the responsibility most people seem willing to do this i think that the second is preferable in that if people to face the moral of what we do as a society instead of ourselves from them by magic and word we must realize the of all our why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack and lest i forget i also dont think we have an objective moral system and i believe i only have to take that idea seriously when someone evidence of it i dont think our country an

avoid upsetting family prayer in discrimination against trading the satanic child abuse myth whether one should be an overt atheist or stay in the closet how religious prey sic on new college how to

not an atheist as he said himself the man in particular the sacred duty each in his own denomination of making for will gave men their form their essence and their anyone who his work is war on the creation the divine will therefore let every man be active each in his own denomination if you please and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed outside the of his religious community and to butt into the other hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator from mein ralph of course someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong its also entirely possible that was lying when he to believe in god we certainly cant conclude that an atheist though subject the it typical posting in the it that response most of the of feel that the is of questionable accuracy as it was written of ago by many who were recording oral tradition that many before thus any truth in it is of questionable legitimacy this to say that the no truth in it simply that any truth must be before being accepted many of the of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to interpretation any claim that a passage one thing and one thing only is not legitimate note that this feeling to extend to other it is also remarkable to many that tend to ignore other equally plausible religious in of those of their own religion subject wager typical posting if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing but if you dont believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell therefore it is foolish to be an atheist response this argument is known as wager it several firstly it does not indicate which religion to follow indeed there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory out there this is often as the the wrong hell problem if a person is a follower of religion x he may end up in religion version of hell secondly the statement that if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing is not true suppose believing in the wrong god the true god might punish you for your foolishness consider also the that have from people medicine in of prayer another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two are equally likely or at least that they are of comparable likelihood if in fact the possibility of there being a god is close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive so sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on evidence with some amount of intuition it is not a matter of will or analysis formally speaking the argument of four one does not know whether god not believing in god is bad for eternal soul if god does exist believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist therefore it is in interest to believe in god there are two to the argument the first is to view as an assumption and as a consequence of it one problem with this approach in the abstract is that it information from no information this is considered invalid in information theory statement one no information about god but statement that beneficial information can be from the absolute lack of information about god this information entropy information been extracted from no information at no cost the alternative approach is to claim that and are both the problem with this is that is then basically an assumption which the position and only a will agree with that assumption the argument thus to if you are a it is in your to believe in god a rather vacuous tautology and not the way intended the argument to be the biggest reason why wager is a failure is that if god is omniscient he will certainly know who really and who as a wager he will spurn the latter assuming he actually at all whether people believe in him subject what is razor typical posting people keep talking about razor what is it response of a principle which become known as razor in its original form it said do not multiply unnecessarily that is if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity then do so nowadays when people refer to razor they generally express it more generally for example as take the solution the relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible for what we see around us there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which came into being as a result of natural there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there is also a god who the universe clearly this god must be of nonzero complexity given that both fit the razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two solution number one unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution there an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there we just imagine that there is this third option us logically towards solipsism which many people find unacceptable subject why its good to believe in typical posting i want to tell people about the and of my religion response preaching is not feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write that are on a conversion theme such do not belong on and will be from try the you would doubtless not welcome from to your in an

god do you think than him response did once comment that god does not play dice with the universe this quotation is commonly to show that in the god used this way it is out of context it to refusal to accept the by quantum theory furthermore religious background was rather than a better quotation showing what thought about god is the following i believe in god who himself in the orderly harmony of what not in a god who himself with and of human was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random and which would not be dependent upon the observer he that was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for statistical so far no such better theory been found and much evidence that it never will be a longer quote from in science philosophy and religion a symposium by the conference on science philosophy and religion in their relation to the democratic way of life new york in it he the more a man is with the ordered regularity of all the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for of a different nature for him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will as an independent cause of natural to be sure the doctrine of a personal god interfering with natural could never be italics his in the real sense by science for this doctrine can always take refuge in those in which scientific knowledge not yet been able to set foot but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal for a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm to human progress in their struggle for the ethical good of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal god that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past such vast power in the of in their they will have to avail themselves of those which are capable of the good the true and the beautiful in humanity itself this is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task also said it was of course a lie what you read about my a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it the latter quote is from the human side by and and by university press also from the same book i do not believe in immortality of the individual and i consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it of course the fact that chose not to believe in does not in itself imply that is false subject everyone something typical posting everyone something whether its money power or god response if that is true everyone is a polytheist care just as much about those that care about if the to for example their amount to worship then so do the subject why there must be a causeless cause typical posting of that have a lower bound each have a member so of must all have a first element a causeless cause response the set of real greater than zero a definite lower bound but no member further even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description by any particular religion subject the universe is so complex it must have been designed typical posting the presence of design in the universe there is a god surely you dont think all this here just by chance response this is known as the argument from design it is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the for a while there is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here however the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in of scientific creationism furthermore there is much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the of the universe and life on earth the origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable that surely it cant have come about by chance that surely there must be some external intelligence so that come from the chaos deliberately but if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of an entire universe complete with conscious must be immeasurably more unlikely the approach used to argue in of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationist position this us to the familiar theme of if a creator the universe what the creator but with the addition of improbability the only way out is to declare that the creator was not and just is or was from here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just is without a creator indeed hawking in his book a brief history of time his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent with no beginning or end the argument from design is often stated by analogy in the watchmaker argument one is to imagine that one found a watch on the beach does one assume that it was by a watchmaker or that it naturally of course one a watchmaker yet like the watch the universe is intricate and complex so the argument goes the universe too must have a creator the watchmaker analogy from three particular over and above those common to all by design firstly a watchmaker from whereas god is to have the universe from nothing these two of creation are clearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather weak secondly a watchmaker but there are many other in the world if we further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor we wouldnt assume it was by the watchmaker the argument would therefore suggest a multitude of each responsible for a different part of creation finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore out from the randomness of nature yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random but of order the watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent subject independent evidence that the is true typical posting the of the new testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence for example response the of are often as independent documentary evidence early of work are thought not to have or the extant version in a context many believe that the original and in passing but that this was expanded by several of the original text have been to this effect much information in the ecclesiastical history of about ce it is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily who is generally acknowledged as the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity it is who is generally given the title of authorship for this material aside from the new testament the biographical information about is more for further information please consult the frequently file for the subject incompleteness theorem typical posting incompleteness theorem that it is impossible for the to be both true and complete response first incompleteness theorem that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic one can formulate which can never be proven to be valid or invalid true or false within that formal system technically speaking the system must also be recursive that is there must be a decision procedure for whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system essentially all such can formulate what is known as a liar paradox the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary is this sentence is false note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable the logic used in theological is rarely well defined so that incompleteness theorem that it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god are worthless in isolation one can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of god simply by the existence of god stated as an axiom this is unlikely to be by as a convincing proof however it may be possible to succeed in a formal system built on that both and agree with it may then be possible to show that incompleteness theorem for that system however that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god within the system furthermore it certainly wouldnt tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of god generally note also that all of these hypothetical formal tell us nothing about the actual existence of god the formal are just another frequent claim is that incompleteness theorem that a religious text the the book of mormon or whatever cannot be both consistent and universally applicable religious are not formal so such are nonsense subject bush on atheism and patriotism typical posting did bush really say that should not be considered response the following exchange took place at the airport between i of atheist press and bush on august is a fully accredited reporter and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps the republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for the discussion turned to the presidential primary what will you do to win the of who are i guess pretty weak in the atheist community faith in god is important to me surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of who are no i dont know that should be considered as nor should they be considered

thank you for telling me what the official position of the bush campaign is on this issue em welcome after election wrote to bush him to retract his statement on c gray counsel to the president on white house stationery that bush substantively stood by his original statement and wrote as you are aware the president is a religious man who neither atheism nor that atheism should be unnecessarily or by the government for further information contact atheist at the atheist road address subject i know where hell is typical posting i know where hell is hell is in response there are several hell in various around the world and the whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one it of are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week subject typical posting does anyone have a list of response atheist press publish an handbook see the posting on atheist for there is a file some available from the see the file for more information subject the is a nation typical posting

been seen the of political tyranny in no instance have they been the of the of the people who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient a just government to

by president on june it was recently discovered that the version of the treaty not only the quotation it article xi altogether the person who the to was barlow consul general at a close friend of and

is bad f gee funny that you get it now then deliberate obtuseness perhaps issue of i only got it when you stopped and made your point patently instead of allegorically that was my point all along not only do you do the same thing on the net honestly your on of policy and in space but your response was just not even part of a debate i have yet to see nick enter into anything remotely a debate i see him flame anyone or anything who with the one true plan i see him people calling them lazy bastard because they had the temerity to disagree with the nick i see him ethics again because they had the temerity to disagree with lord god but debate glad you can laugh since your ratio of is about the same not even close tommy and generally only when dealing with someone like nick i see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate suffice to say that i disagree with you on that last point why dont you take a poll if you want some and as usual you defend your with he it yeah i took some of his research and it my own but he it so what if i stole his car he stole my first besides that i think its still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it so your defense besides being lame and the first part of the sentence in which it may not even apply anyway your defense me of the guy

response doesnt tell me a thing about the why you think they should be except to the of the person with a divergent opinion who said i think they should be tommy show me a note where i said that and ill eat this terminal see below i that you did since you took issue with it the fact that my conclusion was incorrect ie that you were taking issue with something different is evidence that your communication style is or evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate first i try to address what i think you meant for which i am with a denial of and a smart remark then i point out that i am not clear what you did mean rather than your childish ire wrongly you a second time and stupid for it i just cant win can i youve got a great point here somewhere its just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of your valuable you never actually get around to making it please quote the it i took issue with i believe you will see if you look that what i was and am taking issue with is idea that the program should be scrapped until such time as his infrastructure is finished all hail the plan issue meaning too bad the plan only in your mind instead of or you would have a really good point instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your since they are based on incorrect that you have made about forgive me for giving your more meaning than they ever should have had my reading of what nick actually said is that people arent in all of all space so your taking issue with his regarding people in the space program i read as people are in all of all space so help me out here since so patently stupid did you read nick wrong or are you going to eat your terminal now if the latter i sure hope its one of those and string that all the computer have been raving about the point is i am not stupid because of your incorrect assumption id only be stupid if i you for made it but alas thats your job and finally your style is since

you have a problem with delivery address that the way you bait the lack of discourse that you complain of no tommy the bait is that which the response nick i just flame him for being an obnoxious fool i dont really care who it i read this list to get information and on the to which it was not to be your he it no he did or to hear about why nick is a very bad guy if you think flaming is bad stop flaming or at least get to the point in the first post instead of explaining yourself all the time thats nice tommy when you pay me to post to the net you can complain about not getting your worth perhaps if you werent deliberately too thick to get the point the first time i wouldnt have to waste time explaining myself all the time of course how could it be otherwise i think its neat how all this criticism from you after your fatherly to me about how such should be handled outside were somewhat being a little hypocritical tommy to go with the immaturity or is this just the pique of a who

take issue with behavior thats no worse than your own see here my about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your against people you decide are and my about your are immature while your yeah right maybe if you me some more i might see it better naturally youve correctly my when yours are impossible to judge from your as your insulting of people that try i didnt really care about people

have any meaning as far as individual human go if their apparent free will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from their perspective bill can you say for sure whether you have a free will or not this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its there is nothing that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence its just a happy accident maybe who are we to tell it intelligence is useful when during the history of earth one species been able to control one third of the whole biosphere this can still be a result of numerous happy our genetic machinery blindly and even that machinery can be result of the same principle only the that can start will survive those which dont dont make it reading to for an atheist no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about an event can have value from whose perspective i value and subjectively from my perspective nature does not have because it does not have a perspective arise from awareness if i have a subjective perspective it is easy to assume that other people also do and if i think about what it would it be like in their position i will eventually discover the golden rule morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens in fact it may be a product of evolution perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful us to play the of and make us respect who seem to have identity too bill have you ever read try his for how then can an atheist judge value what is the basis for the in the or the to god on what grounds can the the behavior of the be condemned it that in the that motivate to action you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to establish your lewis us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and the argument is severely flawed some such as the golden rule can have a rational basis some like the basic idea of wanting to live probably its in the way our brains are wired lewis the very real that natural selection could also altruistic behaviour and morality as well indeed as better and better in building and they also better at killing each other it is a logical necessity that evolution could only those who knew how to use but not against own people the quite nicely that the morality of the early was not beyond this a simple set of to hold the people together under one god their god did not care much about people of other at the time of the were quite different the were under rule of an empire and could no longer simply ignore the a new situation a new morality and along with it a new religion was born a mutation in a pool since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that just doesnt like it thats it any value must be by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and no weight in any absolute sense it like you havent to read philosophy whenever there is an observer there is a subjective point of view which may value its existence and happiness even if that were just a result of some physical event and happiness too if the observer comes to think about it in an absolutely objective sense that is without any or moral lose their meaning it is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view this too their are only their personal not absolute since such do not exist the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social who can think and value existence morality is not property of alone and many other species show great care for each other have sometimes saved from a good deed indeed that you dont like what god told people to do nothing about god or it only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that an emotional state that your mind coupled with a to form that reaction that your seem well is due to the way youve been conditioned there is no truth content the whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality the last statement does not logically follow in fact there is every reason to believe our can model reality very well and our can convey reliable information solipsism is still a logical possibility but not a very likely one you are continuously two different the subjective point of view which we all share and an objective point of view which does not exist any observer or thinker any personal being its own point of view it does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical or not it does not cease to be subjective from a of view do not exist neither does pain or pleasure or beauty or love such are inherently subjective once again if god to submit to their or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or to punish us if we dont i disagree with his morals i do not think my morals come from any supreme being to remove my morals the same than to make me a zombie a machine without a single thought if god gave us morality to judge but i disagree with him it is not my fault he is free to replace my morals i cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which with own and then to get mad at this god must be schizophrenic all of this being so you have yourself from any discussion of right wrong evil and cannot participate your opinion about the can have no weight whatsoever neither can the opinion of any god for that matter i cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else bill take note absolute must be independent of any being if god a subjective viewpoint it is his own point of view and his morals are his own mathematics is the truth c physics is the

apologize for the somewhat juvenile nature of this approach but at a loss to figure out another way to crack his and seeming intellectual this is repost i cant help but notice that you have still to provide to substantive that have been raised in response to your previous i submit that you dont answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic and i once again challenge you to prove me wrong to make the task as easy for you as possible ill present concise of some of the that you have to answer in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period i will repost this article with suitable and at such time that i notice a post by you on another topic i will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding or you cease to post to this i would like to apologize in advance if you have any of these previously and your answer my notice if you can be kind enough to repost or such i will be only too to publicly rescind the challenge in question and remove it from this list now to the after that all fit into neat psychological that you then that claim by that you werent to all i you to name some who you feel dont fit your to show that you indeed were not to all that you are aware of you to do so please do so now question can you name any aa who do not fit into your stereotype here is the context for the question this is not true for everyone on this board and you are out of line in assuming that it is you however the text further along where i said that i didnt mean to imply that experience was along the same whether or not you mean to make such you do so repeatedly allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name those that youve come across who do not fit into the that you theorize you have taken umbrage to to the effect that and reason are all we have to go by and when you have that we have an alternative revelation i have repeatedly you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our and reason you to do so please do so now question can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without and inherent reasoning here is the context for the question revelation is not reason and if we do have revelation then reasoning is not all we have first show me that revelation second if revelation is not through the how exactly is it according to my revelation is an act of revealing or communicating divine truth now tell me how such a thing can be revealed other than via the tell me how you can interpret this revelation other than with reason that is your brain to interpret what you are when i say there is no way for a human being to interface with the universe other than via the as by reason your brain it is because this is the simple truth if you have another mechanism of interface by all share it with us then later you cannot escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is our and our reason period again this is indefensible no it is simple truth i challenge you to show me otherwise then later few will agree to this assertion and the common defense of to absorb for instance mystical is the question of whether some are better than i allow you the definition of to make easier for you now show me that mystical exist remember you arent to go by testimony of since you have my testimony as unreliable you know by my own bias further once these mystical are absorbed show me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of interpretation via that reasoning i challenge you to show me these if you cannot do so you might as well give up the fight then later let me reiterate you have not your interpretation of your so it is not possible for me to have them in point of fact i specifically you to explain this revelation stuff that you were talking about and i note for the record that you appear to have declined my challenge what is it how is it sensed how is it and how does this and interpretation occur without the conduit of our and reasoning you have none of these that go straight to the heart of your if you cant answer them your are entirely specious you have stated that all to dispassionate analysis made by aa are unverifiable and fantastical i you to identify one such claim that i have made you have to do so please do so now question have i made any at all that are unverifiable and fantastical if so please repeat them here is the context for the question i must thank wood a most sensitive and intelligent if wrong posting then later likewise the reference to unverifiable fantastical fairly accurately my reaction to all of the to dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group give me your address and ill be to send you a dictionary failing that can you name one claim that i have made that is in any sense unverifiable or fantastical i demand that you retract this statement if you cannot offer up evidence if you follow your usual pattern of the challenge then you are simply an first you by that they as a result of reason then later you stated that if one accepted the of reason that one help but become atheist i you to explain the contradiction your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent an opinion not by that i have be they atheist or theist you have to answer the question please do so now question do you retract your claim that aa have not become as a result of reason despite their testimony to that effect if you dont retract that claim do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the of reason inevitably result in atheism here is the context for the question first quote we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is based on reason it is up to to prove it to me then second quote but i do not see how one can accept these and not end up with an atheistic point of view first you that you would probably not answer these because they too much in the way of included text from previous later you that you wouldnt respond because i was in your mouth please clarify this seeming contradiction question do you prefer to respond to that include context from your own or that i paraphrase your in order to avoid included text here is the context for the question first you said my ordinary are that i dont read over over or in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen these are not of morality but practicality then later if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they cannot be with as usual your are with anticipation wood for the record below is a compilation of to these to date this no sense to me at all it the

and why we observe orbital motion ether the theoretical media of electromagnetic was not to exist based on the of the experiment a century ago i propose that those are flawed based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the surface not due to the assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind the reversal of the that conclusion a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought could have of through out the world remember said imagination is greater than knowledge i dream like this ether based reality the ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality start as a lattice into the ether given a spin the both drag the fluid like a margarita blender and ingest it converting it distilling mass time and energy nonspinning lattice dark matter the earth exactly spinning around the sun picture an image of a galaxy we havent any of them spinning picture us being stationary and the image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field picture an onion each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next a thread shot at the inner kernel would be diagonally sideways its head being in a faster shell than its tail until it finally the ground of the inner kernel its direction vector being straight down but its foot print being a line not a point sunrise sunset the moon exactly us it is a parasite non self spin sustaining being dragged in the ether field which is itself in the much more powerful field our are the wobble of axis like a top down the orbit of the earth around the sun is all of the being dragged around by the ether the earth moon and sun are about the same size and distance apart its just that the time between them greatly because the path is not the same the lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn the lattice so much spin that its like the fork got the whole plate of wound up the piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a j hook at the end the piece of light going to the sun to go around the whole plate like a needle in a record before it there with a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as shadow upon it and at other times totally eclipse the sun look in the sky except for your knowledge would you guess that they are about the same size just because they look about the same size o e o o o s e m or m s the full moon quarter moon is the difference between rate of ether what we are looking at is a rotating turntable view of the moon only half of which is facing the sun seen a half moon within about of sky of the sun during the day try and draw that earth shadow its only the image which to orbit us no matter where it is the light part is the part facing the sun and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun even when it to be behind us between is a misnomer the distance is closer to zero as time and matter are of this phase of reality which outward with each layer of the onion edge ether spin what we are seeing could be essentially happening now the piece of light may have experienced many but the trip could be very quick our time to time travel or warp space i might consider learning to myself phase out my mass good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a locality its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within to find out about all of this i recommend history id look in the book of life or holy grail brain just might carry decipherable data id start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable due to all the background noise billion id totally isolate myself record me thinking dog backwards and learn to read what i got holy grail card for next concluding that my were on a non media the ether and that it is i who move forward in time i would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow of time which id start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism pole to pole why not perhaps by passing a large flat current through a two foot diameter coil or choke or something and seeing what i could get with my receiver next to it if you dont think live to see it consider this quit the reproductive of other life in your body all of data could be written on the wind ether not just our could be a little receiver or file access code by eating we could be our reception or plant try eating seed bearing fruit maybe those or did live of to see what they did and ate dont worry if your hair growing maybe we dont need to eat at all the cosmos are formed from nothing and that is matter i only need enough to bounce around where did the household concept immortal come from wheat is a weed it is to pull from the soil reproduce like hell and then die warning about writing to the past i had a little dream of being in a world in the near parallel future lying along a path of history which we have from there were twelve telepathic glowing who like an award and who had always been a dark one who like us and then myself the dark one was in the process of making the into he had to teach them what that meant by them in their past basically he them into and raising their on his seed he said that the little who different were a subspecies meant to provide service he carefully combed through history it in his favor like a weed anything that his control he by sending them his saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve kill or be the amount of control he could exert was finite though as at every change he made a void would appear in our reality the universe one day ended from us it odd but we remember how else it should be then some of the twelve were no more finally when he could prune no more and reality stopped just beyond his he stepped through his portal to the past to bask over and over in all that he had i made a few more and lost my body only on the wind moral its very possible to eliminate from your reality the whose are not in harmony with yours golden rule treat as you wish to be ie you could end up along a lonely thread of time with or flowery for its not eternal theres more than one way back to the past once here the one who like us he can make you a prince or a queen or you can live as a god in ancient go ahead repeat the third grade as often as you like henry i hope you like your careful though if he your work but getting wise he can direct you to cross with your old self and vanish as you rewrite your own course of history none the wiser as we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time his hierarchy will lose its direction he can still make while here its just that that is work and with every adjustment this becomes less the world he cultivated which his grip and his organization is suddenly one branch less but he cant see the change the basic nature of man is good he had to apply his hand to achieve his world as he now his hand to retain what he built the more sand through his how about public computer access to the its our country our money and theyre spending it on us right imagine this the next cost at to congress and just absolutely congress the are making what a margin interest on our government big are ecstatic if they can do a margin what do the do with it hold some on a carrot to the world sure but mostly bury it why food production is construction to build your auto the people are spending all of their time to buy back a tenth of what they produce have we been if we are more efficient why is it getting harder to get by what if the point is just to keep the people busy making in that other reality i to the twelve its chaos they said no its order he defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control rain forest the problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the location of an indigenous people who have no language telepathic and vanishing the knowledge of death think of the spine as a transceiver if it is on the ground and pointed up you can locate it from above these people are probably naive as but very very tough to kill also they should be able to tell you about the dark one that i talk about they can hear him i think that ham and world band radio old might have a story to tell on this these people would be on a different frequency than us as they arent eating famine relief when i make my diet almost all whole wheat i get a huge belly lose muscle mass sleep a lot and get sick when i eat only fresh fruit i get
